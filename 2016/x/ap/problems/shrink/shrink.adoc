==  Getting Started

Welcome back!

As always, first open a terminal window and execute

[source,bash]
----
update50
----

to make sure your workspace is up-to-date.

Next, navigate to your `~/workspace/chapter4` directory.  Instead of downloading a new distro for this assignment, we're going to __recursively copy__ the distro we prepared for http://docs.cs50.net/2016/ap/problems/whodunit/whodunit.html[Whodunit]. If you don't already have that distro, head to the link and download it and unzip the ZIP file according to the instructions there. Confirm you have a `whodunit` directory as with

[source,bash]
----
ls
----

Then, from within your `~/workspace/chapter4` directory, execute the following:

[source,bash]
----
cp -r whodunit shrink
----

This will copy the entire contents of the `whodunit` directory into a newly-created directory called `shrink`. If you navigate inside the new `shrink` directory, you should find that it is an exact duplicate of what was in your `whodunit` directory. Since we'll be using nearly all of the same files, this is good. We can delete a few files though, and we do so by way of the following command:

[source,bash]
----
rm -f clue.bmp whodunit.c verdict.bmp
----

Make sure, though, that after executing that command your directory contains at least the following files:

[source,bash]
----
bmp.h  copy.c  large.bmp  small.bmp  smiley.bmp
----

Off we go!

== Refresher Course

Recall from Whodunit, that a file is just a sequence of bits, arranged in some fashion.  A 24-bit BMP file, then, is essentially just a sequence of bits, (almost) every 24 of which happen to represent some pixel's color.  But a BMP file also contains some "metadata," information like an image's height and width.  That metadata is stored at the beginning of the file in the form of two data structures generally referred to as "headers" (not to be confused with C's header files).   (Incidentally, these headers have evolved over time.  This problem set only expects that you support version 4.0 (the latest) of Microsoft's BMP format, which debuted with Windows 95.)  The first of these headers, called `BITMAPFILEHEADER`, is 14 bytes long.  (Recall that 1 byte equals 8 bits.)  The second of these headers, called `BITMAPINFOHEADER`, is 40 bytes long.  Immediately following these headers is the actual bitmap: an array of bytes, triples of which represent a pixel's color.   (In 1-, 4-, and 16-bit BMPs, but not 24- or 32-, there's an additional header right after `BITMAPINFOHEADER` called `RGBQUAD`, an array that defines "intensity values" for each of the colors in a device's palette.)  However, BMP stores these triples backwards (i.e., as BGR), with 8 bits for blue, followed by 8 bits for green, followed by 8 bits for red.   (Some BMPs also store the entire bitmap backwards, with an image's top row at the end of the BMP file.  But we've stored this problem set's BMPs as described herein, with each bitmap's top row first and bottom row last.)  In other words, were we to convert the 1-bit smiley above to a 24-bit smiley, substituting red for black, a 24-bit BMP would store this bitmap as follows, where `0000ff` signifies red and `ffffff` signifies white; we've highlighted in red all instances of `0000ff`.

----

Because we've presented these bits from left to right, top to bottom, in 8 columns, you can actually see the red smiley if you take a step back.

To be clear, recall that a hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits.  Accordingly, `ffffff` in hexadecimal actually signifies `111111111111111111111111` in binary.

Okay, stop!  Don't proceed further until you're sure you understand why `0000ff` represents a red pixel in a 24-bit BMP file.

Let's look at the underlying bytes that compose `smiley.bmp` using `xxd`, a command-line "hex editor."  Execute:

[source,bash]
----
xxd -c 24 -g 3 -s 54 smiley.bmp
----

You should see the below; we've highlighted in red all instances of `0000ff`.

[source,subs=quotes]

In the leftmost column above are addresses within the file or, equivalently, offsets from the file's first byte, all of them given in hex.  Note that `00000036` in hexadecimal is `54` in decimal.  You're thus looking at byte `54` onward of `smiley.bmp`.  Recall that a 24-bit BMP's first 14 + 40 = 54 bytes are filled with metadata.  If you really want to see that metadata in addition to the bitmap, execute the command below.

[source,bash]
----
xxd -c 24 -g 3 smiley.bmp
----

If `smiley.bmp` actually contained ASCII characters, you'd see them in ``xxd``'s rightmost column instead of all of those dots. (Interesting way to maybe hide some information in a file!)

So, `smiley.bmp` is 8 pixels wide by 8 pixels tall, and it's a 24-bit BMP (each of whose pixels is represented with 24 ÷ 8 = 3 bytes).  Each row (aka "scanline") thus takes up (8 pixels) × (3 bytes per pixel) = 24 bytes, which happens to be a multiple of 4.  It turns out that BMPs are stored a bit differently if the number of bytes in a scanline is not, in fact, a multiple of 4.  In `small.bmp`, for instance, is another 24-bit BMP, a green box that's 3 pixels wide by 3 pixels wide.  If you view it with Image Viewer (as by double-clicking it), you'll see that it resembles the below, albeit much smaller.  (Indeed,  you might need to zoom in again to see it.)

image:small.png[small.png]

Each scanline in `small.bmp` thus takes up (3 pixels) × (3 bytes per pixel) = 9 bytes, which is not a multiple of 4.  And so the scanline is "padded" with as many zeroes as it takes to extend the scanline's length to a multiple of 4.  In other words, between 0 and 3 bytes of padding are needed for each scanline in a 24-bit BMP.  (Understand why?)  In the case of small.bmp, 3 bytes' worth of zeroes are needed, since (3 pixels) &#215; (3 bytes per pixel) + (3 bytes of padding) = 12 bytes, which is indeed a multiple of 4.

To "see" this padding, go ahead and run the below.

[source,bash]
----
xxd -c 12 -g 3 -s 54 small.bmp
----

Note that we're using a different value for `-c` than we did for `smiley.bmp` so that `xxd` outputs only 4 columns this time (3 for the green box and 1 for the padding).  You should see output like the below; we've highlighted in green all instances of `00ff00`.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
    0000036: [green]#00ff00# [green]#00ff00# [green]#00ff00# 000000  ............
    0000042: [green]#00ff00# ffffff [green]#00ff00# 000000  ............
    000004e: [green]#00ff00# [green]#00ff00# [green]#00ff00# 000000  ............
----

For contrast, let's use `xxd` on `large.bmp`, which looks identical to `small.bmp` but, at 12 pixels by 12 pixels, is four times as large.  Go ahead and execute the below; you may need to widen your window to avoid wrapping.

[source,bash]
----
xxd -c 36 -g 3 -s 54 large.bmp
----

You should see output like the below; we've again highlighted in green all instances of `00ff00`

Worthy of note is that this BMP lacks padding!  After all, (12 pixels) × (3 bytes per pixel) = 36 bytes is indeed a multiple of 4.

We asked you a number of questions in Whodunit about the `BITMAPINFOHEADER` and `BITMAPFILEHEADER` that live atop all bitmap image files. Hopefully you recall your answers to those questions (or can open up the file containing your answers!), because in this problem, unlike the previous one, you'll be manipulating the contents of those headers.

Open up `bmp.h` in your `scale` directory, and you'll see actual definitions of those headers we've mentioned, adapted from Microsoft's own implementations thereof.  In addition, that file defines `BYTE`, `DWORD`, `LONG`, and `WORD`, data types normally found in the world of Win32 (i.e., Windows) programming.  Notice how they're just aliases for primitives (standard, built-in data types) with which you are already familiar.  It appears that `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER` make use of these types.  This file also defines a `struct` called `RGBTRIPLE` that, quite simply, "encapsulates" three bytes: one blue, one green, and one red (the order, recall, in which we expect to find RGB triples actually on disk).

Why are these `struct`pass:[s] useful?  Well, recall that a file is just a sequence of bytes (or, ultimately, bits) on disk.  But those bytes are generally ordered in such a way that the first few represent something, the next few represent something else, and so on.  "File formats" exist because the world has standardized what bytes mean what.  Now, we could just read a file from disk into RAM as one big array of bytes.  And we could just remember that the byte at location `[i]` represents one thing, while the byte at location `[j]` represents another.  But why not give some of those bytes names so that we can retrieve them from memory more easily?  That's precisely what the ``struct``s in `bmp.h` allow us to do.  Rather than think of some file as one long sequence of bytes, we can instead think of it as a sequence of `struct`s.

Recall that `smiley.bmp` is 8 by 8 pixels, and so it should take up 14 + 40 + (8 × 8) × 3 = 246 bytes on disk.  (Confirm as much if you'd like using `ls`.)  Here's what it thus looks like on disk according to Microsoft:

image:disk.png[smiley.bmp on disk]

As this figure suggests, order does matter when it comes to ``struct``s' members.  Byte 57 is `rgbtBlue` (and not, say, `rgbtRed`), because `rgbtBlue` is defined first in `RGBTRIPLE`.  Our use, incidentally, of the `__attribute__` called `__packed__` ensures that `clang` does not try to "word-align" members (whereby the address of each member's first byte is a multiple of 4), lest we end up with "gaps" in our `struct`s that don't actually exist on disk. 

Now go ahead and pull up the URLs to which `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER` are attributed, per the comments in `bmp.h`.  These reference guides will allow you go get some answers to your bitmap-related questions from MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network).

== Every Little Bit

Implement now in `shrink.c` a program called `shrink` that resizes 24-bit uncompressed BMPs by a factor of `f`.  Your program should accept exactly three command-line arguments, per the below usage, whereby the first (`f`) must be a floating-point value in (0.0, 100.0]footnote:[Okay, so this won't ALWAYS shrink the file, but unlike http://docs.cs50.net/2016/ap/problems/scale/scale.html[Scale], this program conceivably could.], the second the name of the file to be resized, and the third the name of the resized version to be written.

[source,bash]
----
Usage: ./resize f infile outfile
----

With a program like this, we could have created `large.bmp` out of `small.bmp` by resizing the latter by a factor of 4.0 (i.e., by multiplying both its width and its height by 4.0), per the below. 

[source,bash]
----
./resize 4.0 small.bmp large.bmp
----

You're welcome to get started by copying (yet again) `copy.c` and naming the copy `shrink.c`.  But spend some time thinking about what it means to resize a BMP, **particularly if `f` is in (0.0, 1.0)**.  (You may assume that `f` times the size of `infile` will not exceed 2^32^ - 1.  As for a value of `1.0` for `f`, the result should indeed be an `outfile` with dimensions identical to ``infile``'s.)  How you handle floating-point imprecision and rounding is entirely up to you, as is how you handle inevitable loss of detail.  Decide which of the fields in `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER` you might need to modify.  Consider whether or not you'll need to add or subtract padding to scanlines.

If you'd like to check the correctness of your program with `check50`, you may execute the below

[source,bash]
----
check50 1617.chapter4.shrink bmp.h shrink.c
----

If you'd like to play with the staff's own implementation of `shrink` in the workspace, you may execute the below.   

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/chapter4/shrink
----

If you'd like to peek at, e.g., ``large.bmp``'s headers (in a more user-friendly way than `xxd` allows), you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/chapter4/peek large.bmp
----

Better yet, if you'd like to compare your outfile's headers against the staff's, you might want to execute commands like the below while inside your `~/workspace/chapter4/bmp` directory.  (Think about what each is doing.)

[source,bash]
----
./shrink 4 small.bmp student.bmp
~cs50/chapter4/shrink 4 small.bmp staff.bmp
~cs50/chapter4/peek student.bmp staff.bmp
----

If you happen to use `malloc`, be sure to use `free` so as not to leak memory. Try using `valgrind` to check for any leaks!
