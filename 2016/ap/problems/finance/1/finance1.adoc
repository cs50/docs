== Recommended Viewing

Beyond introducing you to web programming, the overarching goal of this problem is to teach you--nay, empower you--to teach yourself new languages so that you can stand on your own after term's end.  We'll guide you through each, but if you nonetheless find yourself Googling and asking lots of questions of classmates and staff, rest assured you're doing it right!

But first, a (soon-to-be-relevant) clip from a classic film.

You are now a web programmer!  Okay, not quite.  Neither HTML nor CSS are programming languages, but PHP is.  Here's Tommy with a look at PHP.  You'll find that its syntax is fairly similar to C's!

Now let's look at a common "design pattern" for websites called MVC (Model-View-Controller) that we'll ultimately use for this problem set.  Take another look at *mvc-0* through *mvc-5*.

Finally, let's hear about SQL (Structured Query Language).  Here's Christopher and cupcakes.

Phew, bit of a fire hydrant, no?  Not to worry, some fun and more comfort await!

== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope::
  To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?
Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?
Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?
Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

All students, whether or not taking the course for a letter grade, must ordinarily submit this and all other problem sets to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

== Set it Up

Log into https://cs50.io/[CS50 IDE] and, in a terminal window, execute

[source]
----
update50
----

to ensure that your workspace is up-to-date!

Like many previous problems, this problem set comes with some distribution code that you'll need to download before getting started. Go ahead and execute

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace
----

in order to navigate to your `~/workspace` directory.  Then execute

[source,bash]
----
wget http://docs.cs50.net/2016/ap/problems/finance/finance.zip
wget http://docs.cs50.net/2016/ap/problems/finance/finance.sql
----

in order to download a ZIP (i.e., compressed version) of this problem set's distro as well as a MySQL database (that's been exported to a text file).  If you then execute

[source]
----
ls
----

you should see that you now have a file called `finance.zip` in your `~/workspace` directory (along with `finance.sql`).  Unzip it by executing the below.

[source]
----
unzip finance
----

If you again execute

[source]
----
ls
----

you should see that you now also have a directory called `finance`.  You're now welcome to delete the ZIP file with the below.

[source]
----
rm -f finance.zip
----

If you next execute

[source]
----
cd finance
----

followed by

[source]
----
ls
----

you should see that `finance` contains:

[source,bash]
----
config.json  includes/  public/  vendor/  views/
----

But more on those soon.

Next, ensure that `~/workspace/finance/public` is "world-executable" by executing

[source]
----
chmod a+x ~/workspace/finance/public
----

so that CS50 IDE's web server (Apache) and you (from a browser) will be able to access your work.  Then, navigate your way to `~/workspace/finance/public` by executing the below.

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/finance/public
----

If you execute

[source]
----
ls
----

you should see that `public` contains four subdirectories and three files.  Ensure that the former are world-executable by executing the below.

[source]
----
chmod a+x css fonts img js
----

And ensure that the files within those directories are world-readable by executing the below.

[source]
----
chmod a+r css/* fonts/* img/* js/*
----

If unfamiliar, `\*` is a "wildcard character," so `css/*`, for instance, simply means "all files within the `css` directory."

For security's sake, don't make `~/workspace/finance/includes` or `~/workspace/finance/views` world-executable (or their contents world-readable), as they shouldn't be (potentially) accessible to the whole world (only to your PHP code, as you'll soon see).

Okay, let's now configure CS50 IDE's web server (aka Apache) to use `~/workspace/finance/public` as its root. First ensure that no other server is still running (e.g., in another tab) by executing the below.

[source,bash]
----
killall -9 server
----

Next, ensure that Apache isn't already running (with some other root) by executing the below.

[source,bash]
----
apache50 stop
----

Then (re)start Apache with the below so that it uses `~/workspace/finance/public` as its root.

[source,bash]
----
apache50 start ~/workspace/finance/public
----

Next, start CS50 IDE's database server (MySQL) by executing the below.

[source,bash]
----
mysql50 start
----

Then open up `finance/config.json`, which is a configuration file in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which essentially means it's a collection of key-value pairs. JSON is a popular format for configuration files these days, since libraries that can read (i.e., parse) it exist for lots of languages, PHP among them. The curly braces at the top and bottom of this file indicate that the file contains an object, inside of which is one key (`database`) whose value is another object (per
the innermost curly braces). That latter object, meanwhile, has four keys (`host`, `name`, `password`, and `username`), each of whose values is a string, two of which are `TODO`! Those values will be used by CS50's PHP library (which can be found in `finance/vendor`) in order to connect to your workspace's MySQL database. CS50's PHP library includes a function, `query`, that will allow you to send queries to that database.

Anyhow, let's tackle those ``TODO``s! Enter the command

[source,bash]
----
username50
----

and 

[source,bash]
----
password50
----

You should see your *MySQL Username* and your *MySQL Password*. Copy and paste those values, one at a time, into the appropriate places in `config.json`, then save and close that file.

It's now time for a test! Visit `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/]`, where `username` is your own username.  You should find yourself redirected to C$50 Finance's login page!  (If you instead see *Forbidden*, odds are you missed a step earlier; best to try all those chmod steps again.)  If you try logging into C$50 Finance with a username of, oh, *skroob* and a password of *12345*, you should encounter an error about an *Unknown database*.  That's simply because you haven't created it yet!  Let's create it.

In a separate tab, head to `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/phpmyadmin]` (where `username` is, again, your own username) to access phpMyAdmin, a Web-based tool (that happens to be written in PHP) with which you can manage MySQL databases.  (MySQL is a free, open-source database that CS50, Facebook, and lots of other sites use.)  Log in with the same username and password that you pasted into `config.json`.  You should then find yourself at phpMyAdmin's main page.  

Within CS50 IDE, now, open up `finance.sql`, which you downloaded earlier (via `wget`). You should see a whole bunch of SQL statements.  Highlight them all, select *Edit > Copy* (or hit control-c), then return to phpMyAdmin.  Click phpMyAdmin's *SQL* tab, and paste everything you copied into that page's big text box (which is below *Run SQL query/queries on server "127.0.0.1"*).  Skim what you just pasted to get a sense of the commands you're about to execute, then click *Go*.  You should then see a greenish banner indicating success (i.e., *1 row affected*).  In phpMyAdmin's top-left corner, you should now see link to a database called *finance*, beneath which is a link to a table called *users*. (If you don't, try reloading the page.) But more on those later.

Return to `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/]` and reload that page.  Then try to log in again with a username of *skroob* and a password of *12345*.  0:-)

=== `chmod`

Okay, time for a heads-up.  Anytime you create a new file or directory in `~/workspace/finance` or some subdirectory therein for this problem set, you'll want to set its permissions with `chmod`.  Thus far, we've relied on `a+r` and `a+x`, but let's empower you with more precise control over permissions.

Henceforth, for any PHP file, file, that you create, execute

[source]
----
chmod 600 file
----

so that it's accessible only by you (and the workspace's webserver).  After all, we don't want visitors to see the contents of PHP files; rather, we want them to see the output of PHP files once executed (or, rather, interpreted) by the workspace's web server.

For any non-PHP file, file, that you create (or upload), execute

[source]
----
chmod 644 file
----

so that it's accessible via a browser (if that's indeed your intention).

And for any directory, directory, that you create, execute

[source]
----
chmod 711 directory
----

so that its contents are accessible via a browser (if that's indeed your intention).

What's with all these numbers we're having you type?  Well, `600` happens to mean `rw-------`, and so all PHP files are made readable and writable only by you; `644` happens to mean `rw-r\--r--`, and so all non-PHP files are to be readable and writable by you and just readable by everyone else; and `711` happens to mean `rwx\--x\--x`, and so all directories are to be readable, writable, and searchable by you and just searchable by everyone else.  Wait a minute, don't we want everyone to be able to read (i.e., interpret) your PHP files?  Nope!  For security reasons, PHP-based web pages are interpreted "as you" (i.e., under your username) in the workspace.

Okay, still, what's with all those numbers?  Well, think of `rw-r\--r--` as representing three triples of bits, the first triple of which, to be clear, is `rw-`.  Imagine that `-` represents `0`, whereas `r`, `w`, and `x` represent `1`.  And, so, this same triple (`rw-`) is just `110` in binary, or `6` in decimal!  The other two triples, `r--` and `r--`, then, are just `100` and `100` in binary, or `4` and `4` in decimal!  How, then, to express a pattern like `rw-r\--r--` with numbers?  Why, with `644`.

Actually, this is a bit of a white lie.  Because you can represent only eight possible values with three bits, these numbers (`6`, `4`, and `4`) are not actually decimal digits but "octal."  So you can now tell your friends that you speak not only binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, but octal as well.

== Yahoo!

If you're not quite sure what it means to buy and sell stocks (i.e., shares of a company), surf on over to http://www.investopedia.com/university/stocks/ for a tutorial.

You're about to implement (part of) C$50 Finance, a Web-based tool with which you can manage portfolios of stocks.  Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks' actual prices and portfolios' values, it will also let you buy (okay, "buy") and sell (fine, "sell") stocks!  Per Yahoo's fine print, "Quotes delayed [by a few minutes], except where indicated otherwise."

Just the other day, I heard about this great "penny stock," whose symbol (ironically) is *FREE*!

Let's get in on this opportunity now.  Head on over to Yahoo! Finance at http://finance.yahoo.com/.  Type the symbol for FreeSeas Inc., *FREE*, into the text field in that page's top-left corner and click *Get Quotes*.  Odds are you'll see a table like the below.

image::free.png[FreeSeas Inc.]

Wow, only $0.0661 per share!  That must be a good thing.  Anyhow, scroll down to the page's bottom, and you should see a toolbox like the below.

image::toolbox.png[Toolbox]

Looks like Yahoo lets you download all that data (albeit delayed).  Go ahead and click *Download Data* to download a file in CSV format (i.e., as comma-separated values).  Open the file in Excel or any text editor, and you should see a "row" of values, all excerpted from that table.  It turns out that the link you just clicked led to the URL below.

http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=FREE&f=sl1d1t1c1ohgv&e=.csv

Notice how FreeSeas' symbol is embedded in this URL (as the value of the HTTP parameter called `s`); that's how Yahoo knows whose data to return.  Notice also the value of the HTTP parameter called `f`; it's a bit cryptic (and officially undocumented), but the value of that parameter tells Yahoo which fields of data to return to you. Unfortunately, Yahoo sometimes returns prices in currencies other than US dollars (without telling you which), but we'll just assume everything's in US dollars for simplicity.

If curious as to what they mean, here's a https://web.archive.org/web/20040816081607/http://www.gummy-stuff.org/Yahoo-data.htm[handy reference].

It's worth noting that a lot of websites that integrate data from other websites do so via "screen scraping," a process that requires writing programs that parse (or, really, search) HTML for data of interest (e.g., air fares, stock prices, etc.).  Writing a screen scraper for a site tends to be a nightmare, though, because a site's markup is often a mess, and if the site changes the format of its pages overnight, you need to re-write your scraper.

Thankfully, because Yahoo provides data in CSV, C$50 Finance will avoid screen scraping altogether by downloading (effectively pretending to be a browser) and parsing CSV files instead.  Even more thankfully, we've written that code for you - no need to have flashbacks to CS50 Muppet's endless birthday parties!

In fact, let's turn our attention to the code you've been given.

== Walkthrough

=== index

Navigate your way to `~/workspace/finance/public` and open up `index.php`.  Know that `index.php` is the file that's loaded by default when you visit a URL like `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/]`.  Well, it turns out there's not much PHP code in this file.  And there isn't any HTML at all.  Rather, `index.php` "requires" `config.php` (which is in a directory called `includes` in ``index.php``'s parent directory).  And `index.php` then calls `render` (a function implemented in a file called `helpers.php` that can also be found inside of `includes`) in order to render (i.e., output) a view (i.e., template) called `portfolio.php` (which is in a directory called `views` in ``index.php``'s parent directory).  Phew, that was a mouthful.

It turns out that `index.php` is considered a "controller," whereby its purpose in life is to control the behavior of your website when a user visits `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/]` (or, equivalently, `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/index.php]`).  Eventually, you'll need to add some more PHP code to this file in order to pass more than just title to render.  But for now, let's take a look at `portfolio.php`, the view that this controller ultimately renders.  

=== portfolio

Navigate your way to `~/workspace/finance/views` and open up `portfolio.php`.  Ah, there's some HTML.  Of course, it's not much HTML, but it does explain why you saw (and heard!) what you did after you logged in as President Skroob.

=== config

Now navigate your way to `~/workspace/finance/includes` and open up `config.php`.  Recall that `config.php` was required by `index.php`.  Notice how `config.php` first enables display of all errors (and warnings and notices, which are less severe errors) so that you're aware of any syntactical mistakes (and more) in your code.  Notice, too, that `config.php` itself requires two other files, `helpers.php` and `CS50.php`, the latter of which is CS50's PHP library, inside of which is that function, `query`, that will allow you to query your workspace's database. Notice how we configure (i.e., initialize) CS50's library by passing its `init` method (i.e., function) the path to `config.json`. (That `::` syntax just means that `init` is "inside of" a "class" called `CS50`. A class in PHP, meanwhile, is similar in spirit to, but more featureful than, a `struct` in C. Meanwhile, `pass:[__DIR__]` is a constant that represents the current file's parent directory.) Next, `config.php` calls `session_start` in order to enable `$_SESSION`, a "superglobal" variable via which we'll remember that a user is logged in.   (Even though HTTP is a "stateless" protocol, whereby browsers are supposed to disconnect from servers as soon as they're done downloading pages, "cookies" allow browsers to remind servers who they or, really, you are on subsequent requests for content.  PHP uses "session cookies" to provide you with `$_SESSION`, an associative array in which you can store any data to which you'd like to
have access for the duration of some user's visit.  The moment a user ends his or her "session" (i.e., visit) by quitting his or her browser, the contents of `$_SESSION` are lost for that user specifically because the next time that user visits, he or she will be assigned a new cookie!)  Meanwhile, `config.php` takes care to redirect the user to `login.php` anytime he or she visits some page other than `login.php`, `logout.php`, and `register.php`, assuming `$_SESSION["id"]` isn't yet set.  In other words, `config.php` requires users to log in if they aren't logged in already (and if they aren't already at one of those three pages).

=== helpers

Okay, now open up `helpers.php`.  It looks like `helpers.php` defines a bunch of functions, the first of which is `apologize`, which you can call anytime you need to apologize to the user (because they made some mistake).  Defined next is `dump`, which you're welcome to call anytime you want to see the contents (perhaps recursively) of some variable while developing your site.  That function is only for diagnostic purposes, though.  Be sure to remove all calls thereto before submitting your work.  Next in the file is `logout`, a function that logs users out by destroying their sessions.  Thereafter is `lookup`, a function that queries Yahoo Finance for stocks' prices and more.  More on that, though, in a bit.  Below that is `redirect`, a function that allows you to redirect users from one URL to another.  Last in the file is `render`, the function that `index.php` called in order to render `portfolio.php`.  The function then "extracts" those values into the local scope (whereby a key of `"foo"` with a value of `"bar"` in `$values` becomes a local variable called `$foo` with a value of `"bar"`).  And it then requires `header.php` followed by `$view` followed by `footer.php`, effectively outputting all three.

=== header, footer

In fact, navigate your way back to `~/workspace/finance/views` and open up `header.php` and `footer.php`.  Ah, even more HTML!  Thanks to render, those files' contents will be included at the top and bottom, respectively, of each of your pages.  As a result, each of your pages will have access to http://getbootstrap.com/[Twitter's Bootstrap library], per the link and script tags therein.   And each page will have at least four `div` elements, three of which have unique IDs (`top`, `middle`, and `bottom`), if only to make styling them with CSS easier.  Even more interestingly, though, notice how `header.php` conditionally outputs `$title`, if it is set.  Remember how `index.php` contained the below line of code?

[source,php]
----
render("portfolio.php", ["title" => "Portfolio"]);
----

Well, because `render` calls `extract` on that second argument, an array, before requiring `header.php`, `header.php` ends up having access to a variable called `$title`.  Neat, eh?  You can pass even more values into a view simply by separating such key/value pairs with a comma, as in the below.

[source,php]
----
render("portfolio.php", ["cash" => 10000.00, "title" => "Portfolio"]);
----

=== login

Navigate your way back to `~/workspace/finance/public` and open up `login.php`, another controller.  This controller's a bit more involved than `index.php` as it handles the authentication of users.  Read through its lines carefully, taking note of how it queries your workspace's MySQL database using CS50's `query` function.  That function essentially simplifies use of http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php[PDO] (PHP Data Objects), a library with which you can query MySQL (and other) databases.  Much like `printf`, `query` accepts one or more arguments: a string of SQL followed by a comma-separated list of zero or more parameters that can be plugged into that string.  Whereas `printf` uses `%i`, `%s`, and the like for placeholders, though, `query` simply relies on question marks, no matter the type of value.  And so the effect of

[source,php]
----
CS50::query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", $_POST["username"]);
----

in `login.php` is to replace `?` with whatever username has been submitted (via POST) via an HTML form.  (The function also ensures that any such placeholders' values are properly quoted and escaped so that your code is not vulnerable to "SQL injection attacks.")  For instance, suppose that President Skroob tries to log into C$50 Finance by inputting his username and password.  That line of code will ultimately execute the SQL statement below.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='skroob' 
----

Beware, though. PHP is weakly (i.e., loosely) typed, and so functions like `query` can actually return different types. If `query` is passed a `SELECT` statement, it will return an `array` with 0 or more rows. If `query` is instead passed a `DELETE`, `INSERT`, or `UPDATE` statement, it will return a non-negative `integer` that represents the number of rows deleted, inserted, or updated, respectively. For instance, consider the below, which you might find helpful when it's time to implement `register.php`. Note our use of `IGNORE`, which ensures that this statement will return `0` if `username` already exists (because of that column's `UNIQUE` constraint, per `finance.sql`); without `IGNORE`, this statement might otherwise trigger an error.

[source,php]
----
$rows = CS50::query("INSERT IGNORE INTO users (username, hash, cash) VALUES(?, ?, 10000.0000)",
    $_POST["username"], password_hash($_POST["password"], PASSWORD_DEFAULT));
if ($rows !== 1)
{
    // the INSERT failed, presumably because username already existed
}
----

Anyhow, notice that `login.php` verifies a user's password with `password_verify`. See http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php for details. And notice too that `login.php` "remembers" that a user is logged in by storing his or her unique ID inside of `$_SESSION`.  As before, this controller does not contain any HTML.  Rather, it calls `apologize` or renders `login_form.php` as needed.  In fact, open up `login_form.php` in `~/workspace/finance/views`.  Most of that file is HTML that's stylized via some of Bootstrap's CSS classes, but notice how the HTML form therein POSTs to `login.php`.  Just for good measure, take a peek at `apology.php` while you're in that directory as well.  And also take a peek at `logout.php` back in `~/workspace/finance/public` to see how it logs out a user. 

=== styles

Alright, now navigate your way to `~/workspace/finance/public/css` and open up `styles.css`.  Notice how this file already has a few "selectors" so that you don't have to include style attributes the elements matched by those selectors.  No need to master CSS for this problem set, but do know that you should not have more than one `div` element per page whose `id` attribute has a value of `top`, more than one `div` element per page whose `id` attribute has a value of `middle`, or more than one `div` element per page whose `id` attribute has a value of `bottom`; an `id` must be unique.  In any case, you are welcome to modify `styles.css` as you see fit.

You're also welcome to poke around `~/workspace/finance/public/js`, which contains some JavaScript files.  But no need to use or write any JavaScript for this problem set.  Those files are just there in case you'd like to experiment.

Phew, that was a lot.  Help yourself to a snack.

=== users

Alright, let's talk about that database you created earlier (by executing the statements in `finance.sql` in phpMyAdmin's *SQL* tab).  Head back to `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/phpmyadmin/]` to access phpMyAdmin.  Log in as before if prompted. You should then find yourself at phpMyAdmin's main page, in the top-left corner of which is a database called *finance* that has (if you click the *pass:[+]*) a table called *users*.  Click the name of that table to see its contents.  Ah, some familiar folks.  In fact, there's President Skroob's username and a hash of his password (which is the same as the combination to his luggage)!  

Now click the tab labeled *Structure*.  Ah, some familiar fields.  Recall that `login.php` generates queries like the below.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT id FROM users WHERE username='skroob'
----

As phpMyAdmin makes clear, this table called users contains three fields: `id` (the type of which is an `INT` that's `UNSIGNED`) along with `username` and `hash` (each of whose types is `VARCHAR`).  It appears that none of these fields is allowed to be `NULL`, and the maximum length for each of each of `username` and `hash` is `255`.  A neat feature of `id`, meanwhile, is that it will `AUTO_INCREMENT`: when inserting a new user into the table, you needn't specify a value for `id`; the user will be assigned the next available `INT`.  Finally, if you click *Indexes* (above *Information*), you'll see that this table's `PRIMARY` key is `id`, the implication of which is that (as expected) no two users can share the same user ID.  Recall that a primary key is a field with no duplicates (i.e., that is guaranteed to identify rows uniquely).  Of course, `username` should also be unique across users, and so we have also defined it to be so (per the additional *Yes* under *Unique*).  To be sure, we could have defined username as this table's primary key.  But, for efficiency's sake, the more conventional approach is to use an `INT` like `id`.  Incidentally, these fields are called "indexes" because, for primary keys and otherwise unique fields, databases tend to build "indexes," data structures that enable them to find rows quickly by way of those fields.

Make sense?

Okay, let's give each of your users some cash.  Assuming you're still on phpMyAdmin's *Structure* tab, you should see a form with which you can add new columns.  Click the radio button immediately to the left of *After*, select *hash* from the drop-down menu, as in the below, then click *Go*.

image::add.png[Add]

Via the form that appears, define a field called cash of type `DECIMAL` with a length of `65,4`, with a default value of `0.0000`, and with an attribute of `UNSIGNED`, as in the below, then click *Save*.

image::save.png[Save]

If you pull up the documentation for MySQL at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/numeric-types.html, you'll see that the `DECIMAL` data type is used to "store exact numeric data values."  A length of `65,4` for a `DECIMAL` means that values for `cash` can have no more than 65 digits in total, 4 of which can be to the right of the decimal point.  (Ooo, fractions of pennies.  Sounds like *Office Space*.)  

Okay, return to the tab labeled *Browse* and give everyone $10,000.00 manually.  (In theory, we could have defined `cash` as having a default value of `10000.000`, but, in general, best to put such settings in code, not your database, so that they're easier to change.)  The easiest way is to click *Check All*, then click *Change* to the right of the pencil icon.  On the page that appears, change `0.0000` to `10000.0000` for each of your users, then click *Go*.  Won't they be happy!

=== register

It's now time to code!  Let's empower new users to register.

Return to a terminal window, navigate your way to `~/workspace/finance/views` and execute the below.  (You are welcome, particularly if among those more comfortable, to stray from these filename conventions and structure your site as you see fit, so long as your implementation adheres to all other requirements.)

[source]
----
cp login_form.php register_form.php
----

Then open up `register_form.php` and change the value of form's `action` attribute from `login.php` to `register.php`.  Next add an additional field of type `password` called `confirmation` to the HTML form so that users are prompted to input their choice of passwords twice (to discourage mistakes).  Finally, change the button's text from `Log In` to `Register` and change 

[source,html]
----
or <a href="register.php">register</a> for an account
----

to

[source,html]
----
or <a href="login.php">log in</a>
----

so that users can navigate away from this page if they already have accounts.
   
Then create a new file called `register.php` with the contents below, taking care to save it in `~/workspace/finance/public`.

[source,php]
----
<?php

    // configuration
    require("../includes/config.php");

    // if user reached page via GET (as by clicking a link or via redirect)
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "GET")
    {
        // else render form
        render("register_form.php", ["title" => "Register"]);
    }

    // else if user reached page via POST (as by submitting a form via POST)
    else if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST")
    {
        // TODO
    }

?>
----

Alright, let's take a look at your work!  Bring up `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/login.php]` and click that page's link to `register.php`.  You should then find yourself at `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/register.php]`.  If anything appears awry, feel free to make tweaks to `register_form.php` or `register.php`.  Just be sure to save your changes and then reload the page in the browser.

Of course, `register.php` doesn't actually register users yet, so it's time to tackle that `TODO`!   Allow us to offer some hints.

* If `$_POST["username"]` or `$_POST["password"]` is empty or if `$_POST["password"]` does not equal `$_POST["confirmation"]`, you'll want to inform registrants of their error. 
* To insert a new user into your database, you should call
+
[source,sql]
----
CS50::query("INSERT IGNORE INTO users (username, hash, cash) VALUES(?, ?, 10000.0000)", $_POST["username"], password_hash($_POST["password"], PASSWORD_DEFAULT));
----
+
though we leave it to you to decide how much cash, if not $10,000, your code should give to new users. If curious, meanwhile, as to how `password_hash` works, see http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php.
* Recall that `query` will return `0` if your `INSERT` fails (as can happen if, say, `username` already exists).
* If, though, your `INSERT` succeeds, know that you can find out which `id` was assigned to that user with code like the below.
+
[source,php]
----
$rows = CS50::query("SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() AS id");
$id = $rows[0]["id"];
----
* If registration succeeds, you might as well log the new user in (as by "remembering" that `id` in `$_SESSION`), thereafter redirecting to `index.php`.

Here's Zamyla with some additional hints:

video::-b274yKl-4w[youtube]

All done with `register.php`?  Ready to test?  Head back to `pass:[https://ide50-username.cs50.io/register.php]` and try to register a new username.  If you reach `index.php`, odds are you done good!  Confirm as much by returning to phpMyAdmin, clicking once more that tab labeled *Browse* for the table called `users`.  May that you see your new user.  If not, it's time to debug!

Be sure, incidentally, that any HTML generated by `register.php` is valid, as by ctrl- or right-clicking on the page in Chrome, selecting *View Page Source*, highlighting and copying the source code, and then pasting it into the W3C's validator at http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input and then clicking *Check*.   Ultimately, the *Result* of checking your page for validity via the W3C's validator should be *Passed* or *Tentatively passed*, in which case you should see a friendly green banner.  Warnings are okay.  Errors (and big red banners) are not.  Note that you won't be able to "validate by URI" at http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri, since your workspace isn't accessible on the public Internet!

Do bear in mind as you proceed further that you are welcome to play with and learn from the staff's implementation of C$50 Finance at https://finance.cs50.net/.

In particular, you are welcome to register with as many (fake) usernames as you would like in order to play.  And you are welcome to view our pages' HTML and CSS (by viewing our source using your browser) so that you might learn from or improve upon our own design.  If you wish, feel free to adopt our HTML and CSS as your own.

But do not feel that you need copy our design.  In fact, for this problem set, you may modify every one of the files we have given you to suit your own tastes as well as incorporate your own images and more.  In fact, may that your version of C$50 Finance be nicer than ours!

=== quote

Okay, now it's time to empower users to look up quotes for individual stocks.  Odds are you'll want to create a new controller called, say, `quote.php` plus two new views, the first of which displays an HTML form via which a user can submit a stock's symbol, the second of which displays, minimally, a stock's latest price (if passed, via render, an appropriate value).

How to look up a stock's latest price?  Well, recall that function called `lookup` in `helpers.php`.  Odds are you'll want to call it with code like the below.

[source,php]
----
$stock = lookup($_POST["symbol"]);
----

Assuming the value of `$_POST["symbol"]` is a valid symbol for an actual stock, lookup will return an associative array with three keys for that stock, namely its `symbol`, its `name`, and its `price`.  Know that you can use PHP's `number_format` function (somehow!) to format price to at least two decimal places but no more than four decimal places.  See http://php.net/manual/en/function.number-format.php for details.

Of course, if the user submits an invalid symbol (for which lookup returns false), be sure to inform the user somehow.  Be sure, too, that any HTML generated by your views is valid, per the W3C's validator.

Here's Zamyla again:

=== portfolio

And now it's time to do a bit of design.  At present, your database has no way of keeping track of users' portfolios, only users themselves.  By "portfolio," we mean a collection of stocks (i.e., shares of companies) that some user owns.  It doesn't really make sense to add additional fields to users itself in order to keep track of the stocks owned by users (using, say, one field per company owned).  After all, how many different stocks might a user own?  Better to maintain that data in a new table altogether (e.g., `portfolios`) so that we do not impose limits on users' portfolios or waste space with potentially unused fields.

Exactly what sort of information need we keep in this new table in order to "remember" users' portfolios?  Odds we should have a field called `id` that uniquely identifies rows (as the table's `PRIMARY` key). And we probably want a field for users' IDs so that we can cross-reference holdings with entries in `users`. Best to call that field `user_id`, to make clear that it's a "foreign key" (i.e., another table's `PRIMARY` key). We probably want to keep track of stocks owned by way of their symbols since those symbols are likely shorter (and thus more efficiently stored) than stocks' actual names.  Of course, you could also assign unique numeric IDs to stocks and remember those instead of their symbols.  But then you'd have to maintain your own database of companies, built up over time based on data from, say, Yahoo.  It's probably better (and it's certainly simpler), then, to keep track of stocks simply by way of their symbols.  And we probably want to keep track of how many shares a user owns of a particular stock.  In other words, a table with four fields (`id`, `user_id`, `symbol`, and `shares`) sounds pretty good, but you're welcome to proceed with a design of your own.  Whatever your decision, head back to phpMyAdmin and create this new table, naming it however you see fit.  To create a new table, click *finance* in phpMyAdmin's top-left corner, and on the screen that appears, input a name for your table and some number of columns below *Create table*, then click *Go*.  On the screen that appears next, define (in any order) each of your fields.

If you decide to go with four fields (namely `id`, `user_id`, `symbol`, and `shares`), realize that `user_id` should not be defined as a `UNIQUE` key in this table, else each user could own no more than one company's stock since his or her `id` could not appear (as `user_id`) in more than one row).  Realize, too, that you shouldn't let some `user_id` and some `symbol` to appear together in more than one row.  Better to consolidate users' holdings by updating shares whenever some user sells or buys more shares of some stock he or she already owns.  (A neat way to impose this restriction _after_ creating your table is to add a "joint key." After saving your table, click phpMyAdmin's *Structure* tab for the table, then check both `user_id` and `symbol`, then click *Unique* to the right of *With selected*.  That way, `INSERT` will fail if you try to insert more than one row for some pair of `user_id` and `symbol`.)  We leave it to you, though, to decide your fields' types.  (Just know that `user_id` in this table should have a type that's identical to `id` in `users`.  But don't specify `AUTO_INCREMENT` for that field in this new table, as you only want auto-incrementation when user IDs are created for new users.)  When done defining your table, click *Save*!

Before we let users buy and sell stocks themselves (see the forthcoming Part 2!), let's give some shares to President Skroob and friends at no charge.  Click, in phpMyAdmin's left-hand frame, the link to `users` and remind yourself of your current users' IDs.  Then click, in phpMyAdmin's left-hand frame, the link to your new table (for users' portfolios), followed by the tab labeled *Insert*.  Via this interface, go ahead and "buy" some shares of some stocks on behalf of your users by manually inserting rows into this table.  (You may want to return to Yahoo! Finance to look up some actual symbols.)  No need to debit their `cash` in `users`; consider these shares freebies.  

Once you've bought your users some shares, let's see what you did.  Click the tab labeled *SQL* and run a query like the below.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM portfolios WHERE user_id = 9
----

Assuming `9` is President Skroob's user ID, that query should return all rows from `portfolios` that represent the president's holdings.  If the only fields in table are, say, `id`, `user_id`, `symbol`, and `shares`, then know that the above is actually equivalent to the below.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT id, user_id, symbol, shares FROM portfolios WHERE user_id = 9
----

If, meanwhile, you'd like to retrieve only President Skroob's shares of FreeSeas, you might like to try a query like the below.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT shares FROM portfolios WHERE user_id = 9 AND symbol = 'FREE'
----

If you happened to buy President Skroob some shares of that company, the above should return one row with one column, the number of shares.  If you did not get buy any such shares, the above will return an empty result set (i.e., an empty array).

Incidentally, via this *SQL* tab, you could have inserted those "purchases" with `INSERT` statements.  But phpMyAdmin's GUI saved you the trouble.

Alright, let's put this knowledge to use.  It's time to let users peruse their portfolios!  Overhaul `index.php` (a controller) and `portfolio.php` (a view) in such a way that they report each of the stocks in a user's portfolio, including number of shares and current price thereof, along with a user's current cash balance.  Needless to say, `index.php` will need to invoke `lookup` much like `quote.php` did, though perhaps multiple times.  And know that a PHP script can certainly invoke `query` multiple times, even though, thus far, we've seen it used in a file no more than once.  And you can certainly iterate over the array it returns in a view (assuming you pass it in via `render`).  For instance, if your goal is simply to display, say, President Skroob's holdings, one per row in some HTML table, you can generate rows with code like the below, where `$positions` is an array of associative arrays, each of which represents a position (i.e., a stock owned).  

[source,php]
----
<table>
    <?php

        foreach ($positions as $position) 
        {
            print("<tr>");
            print("<td>" . $position["symbol"] . "</td>");
            print("<td>" . $position["shares"] . "</td>");
            print("<td>" . $position["price"] . "</td>");
            print("</tr>");
        }

    ?>
</table>
----

Alternatively, you can avoid using the concatenation operator (`.`) via syntax like the below:

[source,php]
----
<table>
    <?php

        foreach ($positions as $position) 
        {
            print("<tr>");
            print("<td>{$position["symbol"]}</td>");
            print("<td>{$position["shares"]}</td>");
            print("<td>{$position["price"]}</td>");
            print("</tr>");
        }

    ?>
</table>
----

Note that, in the above version, we've surrounded the lines of HTML with double quotes instead of single quotes so that the variables within (`$position["symbol"]`, `$position["shares"]`, and `$position["price"]`) are interpolated  (i.e., substituted with their values) by PHP's interpreter; variables between single quotes are not interpolated.  And we've also surrounded those same variables with curly braces so that PHP realizes they're variables; variables with simpler syntax (e.g., `$foo`) do not require the curly braces for interpolation.  (It's fine to use double quotes inside those curly braces, even though we've also used double quotes to surround the entire argument to `print`.)  Anyhow, though commonly done, generating HTML via calls to `print` isn't terribly elegant.  An alternative approach, though still a bit inelegant, is code more like the below.

[source,php]
----
<?php foreach ($positions as $position): ?>

    <tr>
        <td><?= $position["symbol"] ?></td>
        <td><?= $position["shares"] ?></td>
        <td><?= $position["price"] ?></td>
    </tr>

<?php endforeach ?>
----

Of course, before you can even pass `$positions` to `portfolio.php`, you'll need to define it in `index.php`.  Allow us to suggest code like the below, which combines names and prices from `lookup` with shares and symbols, as might be returned as `$rows` from `query`.

[source,php]
----
$positions = [];
foreach ($rows as $row)
{
    $stock = lookup($row["symbol"]);
    if ($stock !== false)
    {
        $positions[] = [
            "name" => $stock["name"],
            "price" => $stock["price"],
            "shares" => $row["shares"],
            "symbol" => $row["symbol"]
        ];
    }
}
----

Note that, with this code, we're deliberately creating a new array of associative arrays (`$positions`) rather than add names and prices to an existing array of associative arrays (`$rows`).  In the interests of good design, it's generally best not to alter functions' return values (like `$rows` from `query`).

Now, much like you can pass a page's title to render, so can you pass these positions, as with the below.

[source,php]
----
render("portfolio.php", ["positions" => $positions, "title" => "Portfolio"]);
----

Of course, you'll also need to pass a user's current cash balance from `index.php` to `portfolio.php` via `render` as well, but we leave it to you to figure out how.

To be clear, in the spirit of MVC, though, do take care [.underline]#not# to call `lookup` inside of that (or any other) view; you should only call `lookup` in controllers.  Even though views can contain PHP code, that code should only be used to print and/or iterate over data that's been passed in (as via render) from a controller.

As for what HTML to generate, look, as before, to https://finance.cs50.net/ for inspiration or hints.  But do not feel obliged to mimic our design.  Make this website your own!  Although any HTML and PHP code that you yourself write should be pretty-printed (i.e., nicely indented), it's okay if lines exceed 80 characters in length.   HTML that you generate dynamically (as via calls to `print`), though, does not need to be pretty-printed.  

As before, be sure to display stocks' prices and users' cash balances to at least two decimal places but no more than four.

Incidentally, though we keep using President Skroob in examples, your code should work for whichever user is logged in.

As always, be sure that the HTML generated by `index.php` is valid.

Here's Zamyla with some additional tips:

== Check It Out

Before you consider this problem set done, best to ask yourself these questions and then go back and improve your code as needed!  Do not consider the below an exhaustive list of expectations, though, just some helpful reminders.  The checkboxes that have come before these represent the exhaustive list!  To be clear, consider the questions below rhetorical.  No need to answer them in writing for us, since all of your answers should be "yes!"

* Is the HTML generated by all of your PHP files valid according to link:http://validator.w3.org/[]?
* Do your pages detect and handle invalid inputs properly?
* Did you choose appropriate data types for your database tables' fields?
* Are you displaying any dollar amounts to at least two decimal places but no more than four?
* Are you storing stocks' symbols in your table(s) in uppercase?

== Turn It In

. When ready to submit, "export" your MySQL database (i.e., save it into a text file) by executing the commands below.
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/finance
mysqldump -u$(username50) -p$(password50) pset7 > finance.sql
----
+
If you type `ls` thereafter, you should see that you have a new file called `finance.sql` in `~/workspace/finance`.  (If you realize later that you need to make a change to your database and re-export it, you can delete `finance.sql` with `rm finance.sql`, then re-export as before.)
. Toward CS50 IDE's top-left corner, within its "file browser" (not within a terminal window), control-click or right-click your `finance` folder and then select *Download*. You should find that your browser has downloaded `finance.zip`.
. Await instructions from your instructor on how to submit the ZIP file!


This was Problem C$50 Finance (Part 1).
