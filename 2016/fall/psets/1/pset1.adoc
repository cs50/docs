== Getting Started

Recall that CS50 IDE is a web-based "integrated development environment" that allows you to program "in the cloud," without installing any software locally. Underneath the hood is a popular operating system, Ubuntu Linux, that's been "containerized" with open-source software called Docker, that allows multiple users (like you!) to share the operating system's "kernel" (its nucleus, so to speak) and files, even while having files of their own. Indeed, CS50 IDE provides you with your very own "workspace" (i.e., storage space) in which you can save your own files and folders (aka directories).

=== Logging In

Head to https://cs50.io/[cs50.io] and log into CS50 IDE. You may be prompted (again) for your email address. If so, after providing it, click *Private* under *Hosted workspace*, then click *Create workspace*.

You should then be informed that CS50 IDE (aka Cloud9, the software that underlies CS50 IDE) is "creating your workspace" and "creating your container," which might take a moment. You should eventually see your workspace, which should resemble mine from Week 1. If not, do just email the course's heads to inquire!

=== Updating

Toward the bottom of CS50 IDE's UI is a "terminal window" (light blue, by default), a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to explore your workspace's files and directories, compile code, run programs, and even install new software. You should find that its "prompt" resembles the below.

[source,text]
----
~/workspace/ $
----

Click inside of that terminal window and then type

[source,text]
----
update50
----

followed by Enter to ensure that your workspace is up-to-date. It might take a few minutes for any updates to complete. (Be sure not to close the tab or CS50 IDE itself until they do!)

=== Hello

Okay, let's create a folder in which your code for this problem set will soon live. Toward CS50 IDE's top-left corner, you should see a little folder called *~/workspace* in which all of your work will (soon!) live. Control-click or right-click that folder and select *New Folder*. A new folder called *New Folder* should appear; rename it *pset1*, then hit Enter. (If you misname it or can't seem to edit its name, control-click or right-click the new folder and select *Rename* to try again!)

Next, control-click or right-click that *pset1* folder that you just created and select *New File*. A new file called *Untitled* should appear; rename it *hello.txt* (all lowercase) and then hit Enter. (If you misname it or can't seem to edit its name, control-click or right-click the new file and select *Rename* to try again!) You should see that *hello.txt* is indented immediately beneath *pset1*, which indicates that the former is inside of the latter. If *hello.txt* doesn't appear to be inside of *pset1*, simply drag and drop the former into the latter.

Double-click *hello.txt*, and a new tab should appear within CS50 IDE via which you can edit the file. Go ahead and type something simple (e.g., `hello` or the ever-popular `asdf`). Notice that red dot should then appear atop the tab, to the right of the tab's name. That red dot indicates that your file has changed but not yet been saved. Go ahead and save the file via *File > Save* or, more quickly, via command-S (on Macs) or control-S (on PCs). The asterisk should disappear.

Okay, now let's confirm via your terminal window that the file is indeed where it should be and start to familiarize you with that terminal window's command-line interface. As before, your terminal window's prompt should be the below.

[source,text]
----
~/workspace/ $
----

That prompt indicates that `workspace` is the name of your terminal window's "current working directory" (i.e., the folder that's currently open within that command-line environment). The tilde (`~`), meanwhile, refers to your account's "home directory," in which your `workspace` directory lives, but more on that another time. As you might have guessed, this `workspace` directory is identical to that *~/workspace* folder in CS50 IDE's top-left corner.

Okay, let's poke around. Again click somewhere inside of that terminal window and then type

[source,text]
----
ls
----

followed by Enter. That's a lowercase L and a lowercase S, which is shorthand notation for "list." Indeed, you should then see a list of the folders inside of your workspace, among which is `pset1`! Let's open that folder. Type

[source,text]
----
cd pset1
----

or even, more verbosely,

[source,text]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset1/
----

followed by Enter to [underline]##c##hange your [underline]##d##irectory to `~/workspace/pset1` (ergo, `cd`). You should find that your prompt changes to

[source,text]
----
~/workspace/pset1/ $
----

confirming that you are indeed now inside of `~/workspace/pset1/` (i.e., a directory called `pset1` inside of a directory called `workspace` inside of your home directory). Now type

[source,text]
----
ls
----

followed by Enter. You should see `hello.txt`! Now, you can't click or double-click on that file's name there; it's just text. But that listing does confirm that `hello.txt` is where we hoped it would be. (If not, take another stab at these steps or simply ask classmates or staff for some help!)

Let's poke around a bit more. Go ahead and type

[source,text]
----
cd
----

and then Enter. If you don't provide `cd` with a "command-line argument" (i.e., a directory's name), it whisks you back to your workspace by default. Indeed, your prompt should now be

[source,text]
----
~/workspace/ $
----

again. To get back into `pset1`, type

[source,text]
----
cd pset1/
----

and then Enter. Make sense? If not, no worries; it soon will! It's in this terminal window that you'll soon be compiling your first program!

== Hello, C

First, a hello from Zamyla if you'd like a tour of what's to come, particularly if less comfortable.

video::vbkTzOytISY[youtube,height=540,width=960]

Shall we have you write your first program? Inside of your *pset1* folder, create a new file called *hello.c*, and then open that file in a tab. (Remember how?) Be sure to capitalize the file's name just as we have; files' and folders' names in Linux are "case-sensitive." Proceed to write your first program by typing precisely these lines into the file:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
----

Notice how CS50 IDE adds "syntax highlighting" (i.e., color) as you type, though CS50 IDE's choice of colors might differ from this problem set's. Those colors aren't actually saved inside of the file itself; they're just added by CS50 IDE to make certain syntax stand out. Had you not saved the file as `hello.c` from the start, CS50 IDE wouldn't know (per the filename's extension) that you're writing C code, in which case those colors would be absent.

Do be sure that you type this program just right, else you're about to experience your first bug! In particular, capitalization matters, so don't accidentally capitalize words (unless they're between those two quotes). And don't overlook that one semicolon. C is quite nitpicky!

When done typing, select *File > Save* (or hit command- or control-s), but don't quit. Recall that the leading asterisk in the tab's name should then disappear. Click anywhere in the terminal window beneath your code, and be sure that you're inside of `~/workspace/pset1/`. (Remember how? If not, type `cd` and then Enter, followed by `cd workspace/pset1/` and then Enter.) Your prompt should be:

[source,text]
----
~/workspace/pset1/ $
----

Let's confirm that `hello.c` is indeed where it should be. Type

[source,text]
----
ls
----

followed by Enter, and you should see both `hello.c` and `hello.txt`? If not, no worries; you probably just missed a small step. Best to restart these past several steps or ask for help!

Assuming you indeed see `hello.c`, let's try to compile! Cross your fingers and then type

[source,text]
----
make hello
----

at the prompt, followed by Enter. (Well, maybe don't cross your fingers whilst typing.) To be clear, type only `hello` here, not `hello.c`. If all that you see is another, identical prompt, that means it worked! Your source code has been translated to object code (0s and 1s) that you can now execute. Type

[source,text]
----
./hello
----

at your prompt, followed by Enter, and you should see the below:

[source,text]
----
hello, world
----

And if you type

[source,text]
----
ls
----

followed by Enter, you should see a new file, `hello`, alongside `hello.c` and `hello.txt`. The first of those files, `hello`, should have an asterisk after its name that, in this context, means it's "executable," a program that you can execute (i.e., run).

If, though, upon running `make`, you instead see some error(s), it's time to debug! (If the terminal window's too small to see everything, click and drag its top border upward to increase its height.) If you see an error like "expected declaration" or something just as mysterious, odds are you made a syntax error (i.e., typo) by omitting some character or adding something in the wrong place. Scour your code for any differences vis-à-vis the template above. It's easy to miss the slightest of things when learning to program, so do compare your code against ours character by character; odds are the mistake(s) will jump out! Anytime you make changes to your own code, just remember to re-save via *File > Save* (or command- or control-s), then re-click inside of the terminal window, and then re-type

[source,text]
----
make hello
----

at your prompt, followed by Enter. (Just be sure that you are inside of `~/workspace/pset1/` within your terminal window, as your prompt will confirm or deny.) If still seeing errors, try "prepending" `help50` to your command like this:

[source,text]
----
help50 make hello
----

That'll pass the output of `make hello` to a program called `help50`, which CS50's staff wrote. If `help50` recognizes your error message, it'll offer some suggestions (in yellow). Just realize `help50` is new this year, so odds are it won't recognize all error messages just yet!

Once you see no more errors, try "executing" (i.e., running) your program by typing

[source,text]
----
./hello
----

at your prompt, followed by Enter! Hopefully you now see whatever you told `printf` to print?
  
If not, reach out for help!  Incidentally, if you find the terminal window too small for your tastes, know that you can open one in a bigger tab by clicking the circled plus (+) icon to the right of your `hello.c` tab.

== CS50 Check

Now let's see if the program you just wrote is correct! Included in CS50 IDE is `check50`, a command-line program with which you can check the correctness of (some of) your programs.

If not already there, navigate your way to `~/workspace/pset1/` by executing the command below.

[source,text]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset1/
----

If you then execute

[source,text]
----
ls
----

you should see, at least, `hello.c`. Be sure it's indeed spelled `hello.c` and not `Hello.c`, `hello.C`, or the like. If it's not, know that you can rename a file by executing

[source,text]
----
mv source destination
----

where `source` is the file's current name, and `destination` is the file's new name. For instance, if you accidentally named your program `Hello.c`, you could fix it as follows.

[source,text]
----
mv Hello.c hello.c
----

Okay, assuming your file's name is definitely spelled `hello.c` now, go ahead and execute the below. Note that `2016.hello` is just a unique identifier for this problem's checks.

[source,text]
----
check50 2016.hello hello.c
----

Assuming your program is correct, you should then see output like

[source,subs=quotes]
----
[green]#:) hello.c exists#
[green]#:) hello.c compiles#
[green]#:) prints "Hello, world!\n"#
----

where each green smiley means your program passed a check (i.e., test). You may also see a URL at the bottom of ``check50``'s output, but that's just for staff (though you're welcome to visit it).

If you instead see yellow or red smileys, it means your code isn't correct! For instance, suppose you instead see the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
[red]#:( hello.c exists#
  \ expected hello.c to exist
[yellow]#:| hello.c compiles#
  \ can't check until a frown turns upside down
[yellow]#:| prints "hello, world\n"#
  \ can't check until a frown turns upside down
----

Because `check50` doesn't think `hello.c` exists, as per the red smiley, odds are you uploaded the wrong file or misnamed your file. The other smileys, meanwhile, are yellow because those checks are dependent on `hello.c` existing, and so they weren't even run.

Suppose instead you see the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
[green]#:) hello.c exists#
[green]#:) hello.c compiles#
[red]#:( prints "hello, world\n"#
  \ expected output, but not "hello, world"
----

Odds are, in this case, you printed something other than `hello, world\n` verbatim, per the spec's expectations. In particular, the above suggests you printed `hello, world`, without a trailing newline (`\n`).

Know that `check50` won't actually record your scores in CS50's gradebook. Rather, it lets you check your work's correctness _before_ you submit your work. Once you actually submit your work (per the directions at this spec's end), CS50's staff will use `check50` to evaluate your work's correctness officially. 

////
== CS50 Style

In addition to `check50`, CS50 IDE comes with `style50`, a tool with which you can evaluate your code's style vis-à-vis link:https://manual.cs50.net/style/[CS50's style guide]. To run it on, say, `hello.c`, execute the below:

[source,text]
----
style50 hello.c
----

You should see zero or more lines of suggestions. Yellow smileys indicate warnings that you should consider addressing. Red smileys indicate errors that you should definitely address.

*If you instead see `java: command not found`, execute `sudo apt-get -y install default-jre-headless` (which will install software that we forgot to install for you!), then try again.*

*Note that `style50` is still a work in progress (a "beta" version, so to speak), so best to consult link:https://manual.cs50.net/style/[CS50's style guide] for official guidance.*
////

== Smart Water

Suffice it to say that the longer you shower, the more water you use. But just how much? Even if you have a "low-flow" showerhead, odds are your shower spits out 1.5 gallons of water per minute. A gallon, meanwhile, is 128 ounces, and so that shower spits out 1.5 × 128 = 192 ounces of water per minute. A typical bottle of water (that you might have for a drink, not a shower), meanwhile, might be 16 ounces. So taking a 1-minute shower is akin to using 192 ÷ 16 = 12 bottles of water. Taking (more realistically, perhaps!) a 10-minute shower, then, is like using 120 bottles of water. Deer Park, that's a lot of water! Of course, bottled water itself is wasteful; best to use reusable containers when you can. But it does put into perspective what's being spent in a shower!

Write, in a file called `water.c` in your `~/workspace/pset1/` directory, a program that prompts the user for the length of his or her shower in minutes (as a positive integer) and then prints the equivalent number of bottles of water (as an integer) per the sample output below, wherein underlined text represents some user's input. 

[source,subs=quotes,text]
----
~/workspace/pset1/ $ [underline]#./water#
minutes: [underline]#10#
bottles: 120
----

For simplicity, you may assume that the user will input a positive integer, so no need for error-checking (or any loops) this time! And no need to worry about overflow!

Recall that, to compile your program, you can execute the below.

[source,text]
----
~/workspace/pset1/ $ make water
----

And if you see any error messages you don't understand, try running

[source,text]
----
~/workspace/pset1/ $ help50 make water
----

for advice.

If you'd like to check the correctness of your program with `check50`, you may execute the below.

[source,text]
----
check50 2016.water water.c
----

If unsure how to begin, here's Zamyla.

video::oAcVHgmjTHE[youtube,height=540,width=960]

And if you'd like to play with the staff's own implementation of `water` within CS50 IDE, you may execute the below.

[source,text]
----

== Itsa Mario

Implement *one* of the versions of `mario` specified below. Both versions are worth the same (and there's no extra credit for implementing both!), but it's entirely up to you which of the two to implement. The overarching goal is to offer everyone a ceiling that's relative to their own height. Here's some (non-binding) advice:

* If among those less comfortable, generally tackle less-comfortable versions of problems but try at least a few more-comfortable problems this term.
* If among those more comfortable, generally tackle more-comfortable versions of problems unless you really hit a wall with some problem.
* If among those somewhere in between, tackle less-comfortable versions about half of the time and more-comfortable versions about half of the time.

=== Less Comfortable

Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend a "half-pyramid" of blocks before leaping (if he wants to maximize his score) toward a flag pole. Below is a screenshot.

image:pyramid.png[Super Mario Brothers, width="50%"]

Write, in a file called `mario.c` in your `~/workspace/pset1/` directory, a program that recreates this half-pyramid using hashes (`#`) for blocks. However, to make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramid's height, a non-negative integer no greater than `23`. (The height of the half-pyramid pictured above happens to be `8`.) If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than `23`, you should re-prompt for the same again. Then, generate (with the help of `printf` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid. Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window, as in the sample output below, wherein underlined text represents some user's input.

[source,subs="macros,quotes",text]
----
~/workspace/pset1/ $ [underline]#./mario#
height: [underline]#8#
       pass:[##]
      pass:[###]
     pass:[####]
    pass:[#####]
   pass:[######]
  pass:[#######]
 pass:[########]
pass:[#########]
----

Note that the rightmost two columns of blocks must be of the same height. No need to generate the pipe, clouds, numbers, text, or Mario himself.

By contrast, if the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than `23`, your program's output should instead resemble the below, wherein underlined text again represents some user's input. (Recall that `get_int` will handle some, but not all, re-prompting for you.)

[source,subs=quotes,text]
----
~/workspace/pset1/ $ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#-2#
Height: [underline]#-1#
Height: [underline]#foo#
Retry: [underline]#bar#
Retry: [underline]#1#
##
----

To compile your program, remember that you can execute

[source,text]
----
make mario
----

after which you can run your program with the below.

[source,text]
----
./mario
----

If you encounter any errors you don't understand, try asking `help50` for help. (Remember how?)

If you'd like to check the correctness of your program with `check50`, you may execute the below.

== Fun with Algorithms

Implement *either* `greedy` or `credit` based on your own comfort level.

=== Less Comfortable

Ever seen one of these, a "classic coin changer just like [the] ones used by street vendors and the ice cream truck", which lets you dispense coins by pressing levers?

////
http://www.amazon.com/Schylling-CNC-Coin-Changer-Toy/dp/B000KEKB96
////
image:changer.jpg[Coin Changer Toy, width="50%"]

When using a device like this, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you're dispensing for each customer, lest you have to press levers more times than are necessary. Fortunately, computer science has given cashiers everywhere ways to minimize numbers of coins due: greedy algorithms. 

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a greedy algorithm is one "that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the overall, or globally, optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems." 

What's all that mean? Well, suppose that a cashier owes a customer some change and on that cashier's belt are levers that dispense quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Solving this "problem" requires one or more presses of one or more levers. Think of a "greedy" cashier as one who wants to take, with each press, the biggest bite out of this problem as possible. For instance, if some customer is owed 41¢, the biggest first (i.e., best immediate, or local) bite that can be taken is 25¢. (That bite is "best" inasmuch as it gets us closer to 0¢ faster than any other coin would.) Note that a bite of this size would whittle what was a 41¢ problem down to a 16¢ problem, since 41 - 25 = 16. That is, the remainder is a similar but smaller problem. Needless to say, another 25¢ bite would be too big (assuming the cashier prefers not to lose money), and so our greedy cashier would move on to a bite of size 10¢, leaving him or her with a 6¢ problem. At that point, greed calls for one 5¢ bite followed by one 1¢ bite, at which point the problem is solved. The customer receives one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and one penny: four coins in total.

It turns out that this greedy approach (i.e., algorithm) is not only locally optimal but also globally so for America's currency (and also the European Union's). That is, so long as a cashier has enough of each coin, this largest-to-smallest approach will yield the fewest coins possible.

How few? Well, you tell us. Write, in a file called `greedy.c` in your `~/workspace/pset1/` directory, a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then spits out the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made. Use `get_float` from the CS50 Library to get the user's input and `printf` from the Standard I/O library to output your answer. Assume that the only coins available are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).

We ask that you use `get_float` so that you can handle dollars and cents, albeit sans dollar sign. In other words, if some customer is owed $9.75 (as in the case where a newspaper costs 25¢ but the customer pays with a $10 bill), assume that your program's input will be `9.75` and not `$9.75` or `975`. However, if some customer is owed $9 exactly, assume that your program's input will be `9.00` or just `9` but, again, not `$9` or `900`. Of course, by nature of floating-point values, your program will likely work with inputs like `9.0` and `9.000` as well; you need not worry about checking whether the user's input is "formatted" like money should be. And you need not try to check whether a user's input is too large to fit in a `float`. But you should check that the user's input makes cents! Er, sense. Using `get_float` alone will ensure that the user's input is indeed a floating-point (or integral) value but not that it is non-negative. If the user fails to provide a non-negative value, your program should re-prompt the user for a valid amount again and again until the user complies.
  
Incidentally, do beware the inherent imprecision of floating-point values. For instance, `0.1` cannot be represented exactly as a `float`. Try printing its value to, say, `55` decimal places, with code like the below:

[source,c]
----
float f = 0.1;
printf("%.55f\n", f);
----

And so, before making change, you'll probably want to convert the user's input entirely to cents (i.e., from a `float` to an `int`) to avoid tiny errors that might otherwise add up! Of course, don't just cast the user's input from a `float` to an `int`! After all, how many cents does one dollar equal? And take care to https://reference.cs50.net/math.h/round[round] your cents (to the nearest penny); don't "truncate" (i.e., floor) your cents!

Not sure where to begin? Not to worry, start with a walkthrough:

video::2cArM62sC7E[youtube,height=540,width=960]

Incidentally, so that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program's last line of output be only the minimum number of coins possible: an integer followed by `\n`. Consider the below representative of how your own program should behave, wherein underlined text is some user's input.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
~/workspace/pset1/ $ [underline]#./greedy#
O hai! How much change is owed?
[underline]#0.41#
4
----

By nature of floating-point values, that user could also have inputted just `.41`. (Were they to input `41`, though, they'd get many more coins!)

Of course, more difficult users might experience something more like the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
~/workspace/pset1 $ [underline]#./greedy#
O hai! How much change is owed?
[underline]#-0.41#
How much change is owed?
[underline]#-0.41#
How much change is owed?
[underline]#foo#
Retry: [underline]#0.41#
4
----

Per these requirements (and the sample above), your code will likely have some sort of loop. If, while testing your program, you find yourself looping forever, know that you can kill your program (i.e., short-circuit its execution) by hitting ctrl-c.

We leave it to you to determine how to compile and run this particular program!

If you'd like to check the correctness of your program with `check50`, you may execute the below.
