= Water

== tl;dr

Implement a program that reports a user's water usage, converting minutes spent in the shower to bottles of drinking water.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#./water#
Minutes: [underline]#1#
Bottles: 12

$ [underline]#./water#
Minutes: [underline]#10#
Bottles: 120
----

== Background

Suffice it to say that the longer you shower, the more water you use. But just how much? Even if you have a "low-flow" showerhead, odds are your shower spits out 1.5 gallons of water per minute. A gallon, meanwhile, is 128 ounces, and so that shower spits out 1.5 ร 128 = 192 ounces of water per minute. A typical bottle of water (that you might have for a drink, not a shower), meanwhile, might be 16 ounces. So taking a 1-minute shower is akin to using 192 รท 16 = 12 bottles of water. Taking (more realistically, perhaps!) a 10-minute shower, then, is like using 120 bottles of water. Deer Park, that's a lot of water! Of course, bottled water itself is wasteful; best to use reusable containers when you can. But it does put into perspective what's being spent in a shower!

== Specification

* Write, in a file called `water.c` in your `~/workspace/pset1/` directory, a program that prompts the user for the length of his or her shower in minutes (as a positive integer) and then prints the equivalent number of bottles of water (as an integer)
* For simplicity, you may assume that the user will input a positive integer, so no need for error-checking (or any loops) this time! And no need to worry about overflow!

== Usage

Your program should behave per the example below. Assumed that the underlined text is what some user has typed.

[source,subs=quotes,text]
----
$ [underline]#./water#
Minutes: [underline]#10#
Bottles: 120

== Testing

== Staff Solution
You can run our solution by calling `~cs50/pset1/water`. 
[source]
----
$ [underline]#~cs50/pset1/water#
Minutes: [underline]#10#
Bottles: 120
----

== Hints

* `cs50.h` has a helper function `get_int()` that prompts the user to input an integer value:

[source, c]
----
#include <cs50.h>
...
int minutes = get_int();
