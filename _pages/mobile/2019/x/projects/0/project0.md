# Project 0: TODO App

## Objectives

* Become more comfortable with JS and DOM manipulation.
* Gain experience reading and adding to source code.

## Getting Started

Download the distro code for your first game from <https://cdn.cs50.net/mobile/2019/spring/projects/0/project0.zip> and unzip `project0.zip`, which should yield a directory called `project0`.

Then, in a terminal window (located in `/Applications/Utilities` on Mac or by typing
`cmd` in the Windows task bar), move to the directory where you extracted `project0`
(recall that the `cd` command can change your current directory), and run

```
cd project0
```

To get started, follow the directions in your project README.

## FAQs

- Will I be penalized for editing files other than `script.js`?
  - Nope, feel free to edit the HTML or CSS if you feel like it adds to your app!
- Do I have to worry about browser compatibility?
  - Not at all. As long as your app works on Chrome (or any other browser that you
  specify), that's all we'll be using to test your app.
- Can I use an external library?
  - Please stick to just vanilla JS for this project.
