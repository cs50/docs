# Project 1: Pomodoro Timer

## Objectives

* Become more comfortable with JS and React Native.
* Develop workflow for developing mobile apps.
* Gain experience reading and adding to source code.
* Create your first app!

## Getting Started

Download the distro code from <https://cdn.cs50.net/mobile/2020/x/projects/1/project1.zip> and unzip `project1.zip`, which should yield a directory called `project1`.

Then, in a terminal window (located in `/Applications/Utilities` on Mac or by typing
`cmd` in the Windows task bar), move to the directory where you extracted `project1`
(recall that the `cd` command can change your current directory), and run

```
cd project1
```

To get started, follow the directions in your project README.

## FAQs

- Is there extra credit for completing the challenge?
  - Nope, the challenge is just a fun feature that I recommend adding if you finish early!
- Do we need to test on both iOS and Android?
  - Nope, as long as it works on at least one of the platforms, you're all set. We'll assume iOS unless specified otherwise.
