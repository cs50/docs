# Problem Set 2

For this problem set, you'll again use CS50 Lab.

## What to Do

Submit any two (2) of:

* [Caesar](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/caesar/), if feeling less comfortable
* [Vigenère](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/vigenere/), if feeling less comfortable
* [Crack](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/crack/), if feeling more comfortable

If you submit all three programs, we'll record the highest two of your three scores.

## Advice 

* Be sure you've watched Week 2's lecture.
  * You can compile any of the programs from that lecture in Week 2's [sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io/edf25846-8cf8-4391-bda0-8649f25ac1e2).
