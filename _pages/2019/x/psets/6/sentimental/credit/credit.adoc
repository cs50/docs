= Credit

== tl;dr

Implement a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhn's algorithm.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#python credit.py#
Number: [underline]#378282246310005#
AMEX
----

== Specification

* In `credit.py` in `~/workspace/pset6/credit/`, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via `print`) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, exactly as you did in link:https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/credit/[Problem Set 1], except that your program this time should be written (a) in Python and (b) in CS50 IDE.
* So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program's last line of output be `AMEX\n` or `MASTERCARD\n` or `VISA\n` or `INVALID\n`, nothing more, nothing less.
* For simplicity, you may assume that the user's input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card).
* Best to use `get_int` or `get_string` from CS50's library to get users' input, depending on how you to decide to implement this one.

== Usage

Your program should behave per the example below. Assume that the underlined text is what some user has typed.

== How to Submit

Execute the below, logging in with your GitHub username and password when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your password.

```

```

You can then go to link:https://cs50.me/cs50x[https://cs50.me/cs50x] to view your current scores!

== Hints

Test out your program with a whole bunch of inputs, both valid and invalid. (We certainly will!) Here are a few card numbers that PayPal recommends for testing:

https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/payflow/payflow-pro/payflow-pro-testing/#credit-card-numbers-for-testing

Google (or perhaps a roommate's wallet) should turn up more. (If your roommate asks what you're doing, don't mention us.) If your program behaves incorrectly on some inputs, time to debug!
