= Vigenère

== tl;dr

Implement a program that encrypts messages using Vigenère's cipher, per the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#python vigenere.py ABC#
plaintext:  [underline]#HELLO#
ciphertext: HFNLP
----

== Specification

Design and implement a program that encrypts messages using Vigenère's cipher, exactly as you did in link:https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/vigenere/[Problem Set 2], except that your program this time should be written (a) in Python and (b) in CS50 IDE.

* Implement your program in a file called `vigenere.py` in your `~/workspace/pset6/vigenere` directory (if it doesn't already exist, create it now!).
* Your program must accept a single command-line argument: a keyword, _k_, composed entirely of alphabetical characters.
* If your program is executed without any command-line arguments, with more than one command-line argument, or with one command-line argument that contains any non-alphabetical character, your program should print an error (of your choice) and link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit[exit] immediately with a status code of 1.
* Otherwise, your program must proceed to prompt the user for a string of plaintext, _p_, (as by a prompt for `plaintext:`) which it must then encrypt according to Vigenère's cipher with _k_, ultimately printing the result (prepended with `ciphertext:` and ending with a newline) and exiting.
* With respect to the characters in _k_, you must treat `A` and `a` as 0, `B` and `b` as 1, ... , and `Z` and `z` as 25.
* Your program must only apply Vigenère's cipher to a character in _p_ if that character is a letter. All other characters (numbers, symbols, spaces, punctuation marks, etc.) must be outputted unchanged. Moreover, if your code is about to apply the _j^th^_ character of _k_ to the _i^th^_ character of _p_, but the latter proves to be a non-alphabetical character, you must wait to apply that _j^th^_ character of _k_ to the next alphabetical character in _p_; you must not yet advance to the next character in _k_.
* Your program must preserve the case of each letter in _p_.

== Usage

Your program should behave per the examples below. Assume that the underlined text is what some user has typed.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#python vigenere.py 13#
Usage: python vigenere.py k
----

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#python vigenere.py#
Usage: python vigenere.py k
----

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#python vigenere.py bacon and eggs#
Usage: python vigenere.py k
----

[source,subs=quotes]

$ [underline]#python vigenere.py bacon#

ciphertext: Negh zf av huf pcfx bt gzrwep oz

== Testing

To help you test `vigenere`, we've written a program called `devigenere` for you that also takes one and only one command-line argument (a keyword) but whose job is to take ciphertext as input and produce plaintext as output. To use our program, execute

[source]
----
~cs50/pset2/devigenere k
----

at your prompt, where `k` is some keyword. Presumably you'll want to paste your program's output as input to our program; be sure, of course, to use the same key. Note that you do not need to implement `devigenere` yourself, only `vigenere`.

== How to Submit

Execute the below, logging in with your GitHub username and password when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your password.

```

You can then go to link:https://cs50.me/cs50x[https://cs50.me/cs50x] to view your current scores!

== Hints

Not sure where to begin? As luck would have it, this program's pretty similar to link:../caesar/caesar.html[`caesar`]! Only this time, you need to decide which character in _k_ to use as you iterate from character to character in _p_.
