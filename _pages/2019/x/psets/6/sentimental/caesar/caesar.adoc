= Caesar

== tl;dr

Implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesar's cipher, per the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#python caesar.py 13#
plaintext:  [underline]#HELLO#
ciphertext: URYYB
----

== Specification

Design and implement a program, `caesar`, that encrypts messages using Caesar's cipher, exactly as you did in link:https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/caesar/[Problem Set 2], except that your program this time should be written (a) in Python and (b) in CS50 IDE.

* Implement your program in a file called `caesar.py` in your `~/workspace/pset6/caesar` directory (if it doesn't already exist, create it now!).
* Your program must accept a single command-line argument, a non-negative integer. Let's call it _k_ for the sake of discussion.
* If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should print an error message of your choice (with `print`) and link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit[exit] immediately with a status code of 1.
* You can assume that, if a user does provide a command-line argument, it will be a non-negative integer (e.g., `1`). No need to check that it's indeed numeric.
* Do not assume that _k_ will be less than or equal to 26. Your program should work for all non-negative integral values of _k_ less than 2^31^ - 26. In other words, you don't need to worry if your program eventually breaks if the user chooses a value for _k_ that's too big or almost too big to fit in an `int`. (Recall that an `int` can overflow.) But, even if _k_ is greater than 26, alphabetical characters in your program's input should remain alphabetical characters in your program's output. For instance, if _k_ is 27, `A` should not become `[` even though `[` is 27 positions away from `A` in ASCII, per http://www.asciichart.com/[asciichart.com]; `A` should become `B`, since `B` is 27 positions away from `A`, provided you wrap around from `Z` to `A`.
* Your program must output ``plaintext:`` (without a newline) and then prompt the user for a `string` of plaintext (using `get_string`).
* Your program must output ``ciphertext:`` (without a newline) followed by the plaintext's corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext "rotated" by _k_ positions; non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged.
* Your program must preserve case: capitalized letters, though rotated, must remain capitalized letters; lowercase letters, though rotated, must remain lowercase letters.
* After outputting ciphertext, you should print a newline.

== Hints

Recall that `argv` is a list of strings representing the command line arguments. Recall that we can use `len(argv)` in order to figure out how many strings exist in that list; this is the equivalent idea to `argc`, from C.

And so you can access _k_ with code like

[source,c]
----
k = argv[1]
----

assuming it's actually there! And assuming you've imported `argv`, as by:

[source,python]
----
from sys import argv
----

Once you have both `k` and some plaintext, `p`, it's time to encrypt the latter with the former. Recall that you can iterate over the characters in a string, printing each one at a time, with code like the below:

[source,python]
----
for c in p:
    print(c, end="")
----

That `end=""` line just overrides Python's default behavior when printing which, unlike C, tacks on a newline by default!

You may also wish to have a look at Python's `ord()` and `chr()` functions!
