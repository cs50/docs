= C$50 Finance

== tl;dr

Implement a website via which users can "buy" and "sell" stocks, a la the below.

image::finance.png["C$50 Finance",role="related thumb"]

== Background

If you're not quite sure what it means to buy and sell stocks (i.e., shares of a company), head to http://www.investopedia.com/university/stocks/ for a tutorial.

You're about to implement C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks' actual prices and portfolios' values, it will also let you buy (okay, "buy") and sell (okay, "sell") stocks by querying https://iextrading.com/developer/[IEX] for stocks' prices.

Indeed, IEX lets you download stock quotes via their API (application programming interface) using URLs like https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/NFLX/quote. Notice how Netflix's symbol (NFLX) is embedded in this URL; that's how IEX knows whose data to return. If you follow that link, you'll see a reponse in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. It's a bit messy, but notice how, between the curly braces, there's a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, with a colon separating each key from its value.

Let's turn our attention now to this problem's distribution code!

== Distribution

=== Downloading

[source,subs="macros"]
----
$ wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/8/finance.zip
$ unzip finance.zip
$ rm finance.zip
$ cd finance
$ ls
application.py  helpers.py        static/
finance.db      requirements.txt  templates/
----

=== Configuring

Before getting started on this assignment, we'll need to register for an API key in order to be able to query IEX's data. To do so, follow these steps:

. Visit https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/[iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/].
. Enter your email address and a password, and click "Create account".
. Once you've confirmed your account via a confirmation email, sign in to https://iexcloud.io/[iexcloud.io].
. Click *API Tokens*.
. Copy the key that appears under the *Token* column (it should begin with `pk_`).
. In a terminal window within CS50 IDE, execute:
+
[source]
----
export API_KEY=value
----
+
where `value` is that (pasted) value, without any space immediately before or after the `=`. You also may wish to paste that value in a text document somewhere, in case you need it again later.

=== Running

. Start Flask's built-in web server (within `finance/`):
+
[source]
----
flask run
----
+
Visit the URL outputted by `flask` to see the distribution code in action. You won't be able to log in or register, though, just yet!
. Via CS50's file browser, double-click *finance.db* in order to open it with phpLiteAdmin. Notice how `finance.db` comes with a table called `users`. Take a look at its structure (i.e., schema). Notice how, by default, new users will receive $10,000 in cash. But there aren't (yet!) any users (i.e., rows) therein to browse.
+
Here on out, if you'd prefer a command line, you're welcome to use `sqlite3` instead of phpLiteAdmin.

=== Understanding

==== `application.py`

Open up `application.py`. Atop the file are a bunch of imports, among them CS50's SQL module and a few helper functions. More on those soon.

After configuring http://flask.pocoo.org/[Flask], notice how this file disables caching of responses (provided you're in debugging mode, which you are by default on CS50 IDE), lest you make a change to some file but your browser not notice. Notice next how it configures http://jinja.pocoo.org/[Jinja] with a custom "filter," `usd`, a function (defined in `helpers.py`) that will make it easier to format values as US dollars (USD). It then further configures Flask to store http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#sessions[sessions] on the local filesystem (i.e., disk) as opposed to storing them inside of (digitally signed) cookies, which is Flask's default. The file then configures CS50's SQL module to use `finance.db`, a SQLite database whose contents we'll soon see!

Thereafter are a whole bunch of routes, only two of which are fully implemented: `login` and `logout`. Read through the implementation of `login` first. Notice how it uses `db.execute` (from CS50's library) to query `finance.db`. And notice how it uses `check_password_hash` to compare hashes of users' passwords. Finally, notice how `login` "remembers" that a user is logged in by storing his or her `user_id`, an INTEGER, in `session`. That way, any of this file's routes can check which user, if any, is logged in. Meanwhile, notice how `logout` simply clears `session`, effectively logging a user out.

Notice how most routes are "decorated" with `@login_required` (a function defined in `helpers.py` too). That decorator ensures that, if a user tries to visit any of those routes, he or she will first be redirected to `login` so as to log in.

Notice too how most routes support GET and POST. Even so, most of them (for now!) simply return an "apology," since they're not yet implemented.

==== `helpers.py`

Next take a look at `helpers.py`. Ah, there's the implementation of `apology`. Notice how it ultimately renders a template, `apology.html`. It also happens to define within itself another function, `escape`, that it simply uses to replace special characters in apologies. By defining `escape` inside of `apology`, we've scoped the former to the latter alone; no other functions will be able (or need) to call it.

Next in the file is `login_required`. No worries if this one's a bit cryptic, but if you've ever wondered how a function can return another function, here's an example!

Thereafter is `lookup`, a function that, given a `symbol` (e.g., NFLX), returns a stock quote for a company in the form of a `dict` with three keys: `name`, whose value is a `str`, the name of the company; `price`, whose value is a `float`; and `symbol`, whose value is a `str`, a canonicalized (uppercase) version of a stock's symbol, irrespective of how that symbol was capitalized when passed into `lookup`.

Last in the file is `usd`, a short function that simply formats a `float` as USD (e.g., `1234.56` is formatted as `$1,234.56`).

==== `requirements.txt`

Next take a quick look at `requirements.txt`. That file simply prescribes the packages on which this app will depend.

==== `static/`

Glance too at `static/`, inside of which is `styles.css`. That's where some initial CSS lives. You're welcome to alter it as you see fit.

==== `templates/`

Now look in `templates/`. In `login.html` is, essentially, just an HTML form, stylized with http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap]. In `apology.html`, meanwhile, is a template for an apology. Recall that `apology` in `helpers.py` took two arguments: `message`, which was passed to `render_template` as the value of `bottom`, and, optionally, `code`, which was passed to `render_template` as the value of `top`. Notice in `apology.html` how those values are ultimately used! And https://github.com/jacebrowning/memegen[here's why]. 0:-)

Last up is `layout.html`. It's a bit bigger than usual, but that's mostly because it comes with a fancy, mobile-friendly "navbar" (navigation bar), also based on Bootstrap. Notice how it defines a block, `main`, inside of which templates (including `apology.html` and `login.html`) shall go. It also includes support for Flask's http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/flashing/[message flashing] so that you can relay messages from one route to another for the user to see.

== Specification

=== `register`

Complete the implementation of `register` in such a way that it allows a user to register for an account via a form.

* Require that a user input a username, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `username`. Render an apology if the user's input is blank or the username already exists.
* Require that a user input a password, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `password`, and then that same password again, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `confirmation`. Render an apology if either input is blank or the passwords do not match.
* Submit the user's input via `POST` to `/register`.
* `INSERT` the new user into `users`, storing a hash of the user's password, not the password itself. Hash the user's password with http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.14/utils/#werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash[`generate_password_hash`].
* Odds are you'll want to create a new template (e.g., `register.html`) that's quite similar to `login.html`.

Once you've implemented `register` correctly, you should be able to register for an account and log in (since `login` and `logout` already work)! And you should be able to see your rows via phpLiteAdmin or `sqlite3`.

=== `quote`

Complete the implementation of `quote` in such a way that it allows a user to look up a stock's current price.

* Require that a user input a stock's symbol, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `symbol`.
* Submit the user's input via `POST` to `/quote`.
* Odds are you'll want to create two new templates (e.g., `quote.html` and `quoted.html`). When a user visits `/quote` via GET, render one of those templates, inside of which should be an HTML form that submits to `/quote` via POST. In response to a POST, `quote` can render that second template, embedding within it one or more values from `lookup`.

=== `buy`

Complete the implementation of `buy` in such a way that it enables a user to buy stocks.

* Require that a user input a stock's symbol, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `symbol`. Render an apology if the input is blank or the symbol does not exist (as per the return value of `lookup`).
* Require that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `shares`. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer.
* Submit the user's input via `POST` to `/buy`.
* Odds are you'll want to call `lookup` to look up a stock's current price.
* Odds are you'll want to `SELECT` how much cash the user currently has in `users`.
* Add one or more new tables to `finance.db` via which to keep track of the purchase. Store enough information so that you know who bought what at what price and when.
** Use appropriate SQLite types.
** Define `UNIQUE` indexes on any fields that should be unique.
** Define (non-`UNIQUE`) indexes on any fields via which you will search (as via `SELECT` with `WHERE`).
* Render an apology, without completing a purchase, if the user cannot afford the number of shares at the current price.
* You don't need to worry about race conditions (or use transactions).

Once you've implemented `buy` correctly, you should be able to see users' purchases in your new table(s) via phpLiteAdmin or `sqlite3`.

=== `index`

Complete the implementation of `index` in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing, for the user currently logged in, which stocks the user owns, the numbers of shares owned, the current price of each stock, and the total value of each holding (i.e., shares times price). Also display the user's current cash balance along with a grand total (i.e., stocks' total value plus cash).

* Odds are you'll want to execute multiple ``SELECT``s. Depending on how you implement your table(s), you might find https://www.google.com/search?q=SQLite+GROUP+BY[GROUP BY], https://www.google.com/search?q=SQLite+HAVING[HAVING], https://www.google.com/search?q=SQLite+SUM[SUM], and/or https://www.google.com/search?q=SQLite+WHERE[WHERE] of interest.
* Odds are you'll want to call `lookup` for each stock.

=== `sell`

Complete the implementation of `sell` in such a way that it enables a user to sell shares of a stock (that he or she owns).

* Require that a user input a stock's symbol, implemented as a `select` menu whose `name` is `symbol`. Render an apology if the user fails to select a stock or if (somehow, once submitted) the user does not own any shares of that stock.
* Require that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose `name` is `shares`. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer or if the user does not own that many shares of the stock.
* Submit the user's input via `POST` to `/sell`.
* You don't need to worry about race conditions (or use transactions).

=== `history`

Complete the implementation of `history` in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user's transactions ever, listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.

* For each row, make clear whether a stock was bought or sold and include the stock's symbol, the (purchase or sale) price, the number of shares bought or sold, and the date and time at which the transaction occurred.
* You might need to alter the table you created for `buy` or supplement it with an additional table. Try to minimize redundancies.

=== `check`

Complete the implementation of `check` in such a way that it checks whether a username is available.

* The route should accept, via GET, an HTTP parameter called `username`.
* If the value of `username` is of length at least 1 and does not already belong to a user in the database, the route should return, in JSON format, `true`, signifying that the username is (as of that moment) available. Else it should return, in JSON format, `false`. Recall that `jsonify` in Flask can return a value in JSON format.

Finally, enhance your template for `register` with some JavaScript in such a way that it prevents submission of your registration form if the inputted username is already taken, letting the user know, as via `alert` or via a Bootstrap http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/[alert] or http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/forms/#validation[validation].

* Use Ajax (e.g., jQuery's https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/[`$.get`] method) to query `/check` to check whether the inputted username is available.
* Recall that you can prevent submission of a form with https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_preventdefault.asp[`preventDefault`], and you can programmatically induce submission of a form (once validated by you) with https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_form_submit.asp[`submit`].

=== personal touch

Implement at least one personal touch of your choice:

* Allow users to change their passwords.
* Allow users to add additional cash to their account.
* Allow users to buy more shares or sell shares of stocks they already own via `index` itself, without having to type stocks' symbols manually.
* Require users' passwords to have some number of letters, numbers, and/or symbols.
* Implement some other feature of comparable scope.

== Walkthroughs

*Instead of `pwd_context.encrypt`, which Zamyla mentions, be sure to use `generate_password_hash` instead.*

*Note that Zamyla does not discuss `/check`, but you should still implement it!*

== Testing

Be sure to test your web app manually too, as by

* inputting alpabetical strings into forms when only numbers are expected,
* inputting zero or negative numbers into forms when only positive numbers are expected,
* inputting floating-point values into forms when only integers are expected,
* trying to spend more cash than a user has,
* trying to sell more shares than a user has,
* inputting an invalid stock symbol, and
* including potentially dangerous characters like `'` and `;` in SQL queries.

== Staff's Solution

You're welcome to stylize your own app differently, but here's what the staff's solution looks like!

http://finance.cs50.net/

Feel free to register for an account and play around. Do *not* use a password that you use on other sites.

It is *reasonable* to look at the staff's HTML and CSS.

== Hints

* Within `cs50.SQL` is an `execute` method whose first argument should be a `str` of SQL. If that `str` contains named parameters to which values should be bound, those values can be provided as additional named parameters to `execute`. See the implementation of `login` for one such example. The return value of `execute` is as follows:
+
--
** If `str` is a `SELECT`, then `execute` returns a `list` of zero or more `dict` objects, inside of which are keys and values representing a table's fields and cells, respectively.
** If `str` is an `INSERT`, and the table into which data was inserted contains an autoincrementing `PRIMARY KEY`, then `execute` returns the value of the newly inserted row's primary key.
** If `str` is a `DELETE` or an `UPDATE`, then `execute` returns the number of rows deleted or updated by `str`.
--
+
If an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` would violate some constraint (e.g., a `UNIQUE` index), then `execute` returns `None`. In cases of error, `execute` raises a `RuntimeError`.
* Recall that `cs50.SQL` will log to your terminal window any queries that you execute via `execute` (so that you can confirm whether they're as intended).
* Be sure to use named bind parameters (i.e., a https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#paramstyle[paramstyle] of `named`) when calling CS50's `execute` method, a la `WHERE name=:name`. Do *not* use f-strings, https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#format[`format`], or `+` (i.e., concatenation), lest you risk a SQL injection attack.
* If (and only if) already comfortable with SQL, you're welcome to use http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/index.html[SQLAlchemy Core] or http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/[Flask-SQLAlchemy] (i.e., http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/index.html[SQLAlchemy ORM]) instead of `cs50.SQL`.
* You're welcome to add additional static files to `static/`.
* Odds are you'll want to consult http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/[Jinja's documentation] when implementing your templates.
* It is *reasonable* to ask others to try out (and try to trigger errors in) your site. Via *Share* in CS50 IDE's top-right corner can you share your *Application* by making it *Public*. Take care not to share your *Editor*, which would provide access to your Python code and SQLite database.
* You're welcome to alter the aesthetics of the sites, as via
** https://bootswatch.com/,
** https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/,
** https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/, and/or
** https://memegen.link/.

== FAQs

=== ImportError: No module named 'application'

By default, `flask` looks for a file called `application.py` in your current working directory (because we've configured the value of `FLASK_APP`, an environment variable, to be `application.py`). If seeing this error, odds are you've run `flask` in the wrong directory!

=== OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use

If, upon running `flask`, you see this error, odds are you (still) have `flask` running in another tab. Be sure to kill that other process, as with ctrl-c, before starting `flask` again. If you haven't any such other tab, execute `fuser -k 8080/tcp` to kill any processes that are (still) listening on TCP port 8080.

=== check50 ran into an error while running checks!

If, upon running `check50`, you see this error, odds are you have a bug in your code somewhere! Open up the CS50.me produced by `check50` to see a detailed traceback to help you debug!

=== check50 is taking longer than normal!

If you see this, make sure to remove or comment out any print statements from application.py and try `check50` again.


== How to Submit

Execute the below from within your `~/workspace/pset8/finance` directory, logging in with your GitHub username and password when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your password.
