= Problem: Mario

== tl;dr

Implement a program that prints out a half-pyramid of a specified height, per the below.

[source, subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#5#
    pass:[#]
   pass:[##]
  pass:[###]
 pass:[####]
pass:[#####]

$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#3#
  pass:[#]
 pass:[##]
pass:[###]

== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along three axes primarily.

Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Background

Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend a "half-pyramid" of blocks before leaping (if he wants to maximize his score) toward a flag pole. Below is a screenshot.

== Specification

* Write, in a file called `mario.c` in your `~/unit1/mario/` directory, a program that recreates this half-pyramid using hashes (`#`) for blocks.
* And let's allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramid should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.
* If the user doesn't, in fact, input a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive, when prompted, the program should re-prompt the user until they cooperate.
* Then, generate (with the help of `printf` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.

== Pseudocode

First, write in `pseudocode.txt` at right some pseudocode that implements this program, even if not (yet!) sure how to write it in code. There's no one right way to write pseudocode, but short English sentences suffice. Recall how we wrote pseudocode for finding Mike Smith. Odds are your pseudocode will use (or imply using!) one or more functions, conditions, Boolean expressions, loops, and/or variables.

There's more than one way to do this, so here's just one!

. Prompt user for height
. If height is less than 1 or greater than 8 (or not an integer at all), go back one step
. Iterate from 1 through height:
.. On iteration i, print i hashes and then a newline

It's okay to edit your own after seeing this pseudocode here, but don't simply copy/paste ours into your own!

== Prompting for Input

Whatever your pseudocode, let's first write only the C code that prompts (and re-prompts, as needed) the user for input.

Specifically, modify `mario.c` at right in such a way that it prompts the user for the pyramid's height, storing their input in a variable, re-prompting the user again and again as needed if their input is not a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive. Then, simply print the value of that variable, thereby confirming (for yourself) that you've indeed stored the user's input successfully, a la the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ ./mario
Height: -1
Height: 0
Height: 42
Height: 50
Height: 4
Stored: 4
----

* Recall that you can compile your program with `make`.
* Recall that you can print an `int` with printf using `%i`.
* Recall that you can get an integer from the user with `get_int`.
* Recall that `get_int` is declared in `cs50.h`.

== Building the Opposite

Now that your program is (hopefully!) accepting input as prescribed, it's time for another step.

It turns out it's a bit easier to build a left-aligned pyramid than right-, a la the below.

[source, subs="macros,quotes"]
----
pass:[#]
pass:[##]
pass:[###]
pass:[####]
pass:[#####]
pass:[######]
pass:[#######]
pass:[########]
----

So let's build a left-aligned pyramid first and then, once that's working, right-align it instead!

Modify `mario.c` at right such that it no longer simply prints the user's input but instead prints a left-aligned pyramid of that height.

== Right Aligning

Let's now right-align that pyramid by pushing its hashes to the right by prefixing them with dots (i.e., periods), a la the below.

[source, subs="macros,quotes"]
----
pass:[.......#]
pass:[......##]
pass:[.....###]
pass:[....####]
pass:[...#####]
pass:[..######]
pass:[.#######]
pass:[########]
----

Modify `mario.c` in such a way that it does exactly that!

Notice how the number of dots needed on each line is the "opposite" of the number of that line's hashes. For a pyramid of height 8, like the above, the first line has but 1 hash and thus 7 dots. The bottom line, meanwhile, has 8 hashes and thus 0 dots. Via what formula (or arithmetic, really) could you print that many dots?

=== How to Test Your Code

Does your code work as prescribed when you input

* -1 (or other negative numbers)?
* 0?
* 1 through 8?
* 9 or other positive numbers?
* letters or words?
* no input at all, when you only hit Enter?

== Remove the Dots

All that remains now is a finishing flourish! Modify `mario.c` in such a way that it prints spaces instead of those dots!

A space is just a press of your space bar, just as a period is just a press of its key! Just remember that `printf` requires that you surround both with double quotes!


== Testing

=== Correctness

== Staff Solution

== Hints

Try to establish a relationship between (a) the height the user would like the pyramid to be, (b) what row is currently being printed, and (c) how many spaces and how many hashes are in that row. Once you establish the formula, you can translate that to C!

== How to Submit

=== Step 1 of 2

Ensure that `mario.c` is in `~/unit1/mario`, as with:

[source]
----
cd ~/unit1/mario
ls
----

If `mario.c` is not in `~/unit1/mario`, move it into that directory, as via `mv` (or via CS50 IDE's lefthand file browser).

=== Step 2 of 2

* To submit `mario`, execute
+
[source]
----
cd ~/unit1/mario
submit50 cs50/2019/ap/mario/less
----

If you run into any trouble, email sysadmins@cs50.harvard.edu!

You may resubmit any problem as many times as you'd like before the deadline.
   
Your submission should be graded for correctness within 2 minutes, at which point your score will appear at https://cs50.me/[cs50.me]

This was Mario.
