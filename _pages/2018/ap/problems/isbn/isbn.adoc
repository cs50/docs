== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along three axes primarily.

Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Readin' Bookz

As you may know, most any book that you borrow or buy has an International Standard Book Number, otherwise known as an __ISBN__ or ISBN-10, "a 10-digit number that uniquely identifies books and book-like products published internationally."footnote:[http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/us/isbnqa.asp] Books published since 2007 might also have an ISBN-13, a 13-digit number with a similar purpose, but never mind those.

It turns out that the last of an ISBN-10's digits is a "check digit," otherwise known (in binary contexts) as a "checksum," a number related mathematically to its preceding digits. ISBN-10s' digits are supposed to adhere to a formula, not unlike credit card numbers, and this check digit allows you to check whether an ISBN-10's other nine digits are (most likely) valid without having to check, say, a database of books.

Per the International ISBN Agency's ISBN Users' Manual, "The check digit is the last digit of an ISBN. It is calculated on a modulus 11 with weights 10-2, using X in lieu of 10 where ten would occur as a check digit."footnote:[http://www.isbn-international.org/en/userman/download/ISBNmanual.pdf]

Yes rly, but what does that mean? The manual elaborates. "This means that each of the first nine digits of the ISBN--excluding the check digit itself--is multiplied by a number ranging from 10 to 2 and that the resulting sum of the products, plus the check digit, must be divisible by 11 without a remainder."

Okay, better, but still a bit unclear. Let's define the check digit in terms of a formula. Fortunately, thanks to "modular arithmetic," we can simplify the Agency's formal definition using weights ranging from 1 to 9 instead of 10 to 2. In fact, it's really quite simple. If x~1~ represents an ISBN-10's first digit and x~10~ its lastfootnote:[Normally, we'd start counting from 0 and not 1, but for ISBN-10s, it's simpler not to!], it turns out that:

x~10~ = (1&middot;x~1~ + 2&middot;x~2~ + 3&middot;x~3~ + 4&middot;x~4~ + 5&middot;x~5~ + 6&middot;x~6~ + 7&middot;x~7~ + 8&middot;x~8~ + 9&middot;x~9~) mod 11

In other words, to compute an ISBN-10's tenth digit, multiply its first digit by 1, its second digit by 2, its third digit by 3, its fourth digit by 4, its fifth digit by 5, its sixth digit by 6, its seventh digit by 7, its eighth digit by 8, and its ninth digit by 9. Take the sum of those products and then divide it
by 11. The remainder should be the ISBN-10's tenth digit! If, though, that remainder is 10, the tenth digit should instead be printed as `X` lest it be confused with a `1` followed by `0`.

== I S BN Calculatin'

Let's try all this out. The ISBN-10 for the _Absolute Beginner's Guide to C_, one of the course's recommended books, is 0-789-75198-4, the tenth digit of which is, obviously, 4. But is the syllabus right? Well, let's first take that sum using the ISBN-10's first nine digits (highlighted in bold):

1&middot;**0** + 2&middot;**7** + 3&middot;**8** + 4&middot;**9** + 5&middot;**7** + 6&middot;**5** + 7&middot;**1** + 8&middot;**9** + 9&middot;**8** = 290

If we now divide that sum by 11, we get 290 &divide; 11 = 26 4/11 (i.e., a remainder of 4)! Well that's kind of neat, the ISBN is legit! Actually, also thanks to modular arithmetic, we could just include that tenth digit in our sum and multiply it by 10:

1&middot;**0** + 2&middot;**7** + 3&middot;**8** + 4&middot;**9** + 5&middot;**7** + 6&middot;**5** + 7&middot;**1** + 8&middot;**9** + 9&middot;**8** + 10&middot;**4** = 330

If we now divide this sum by 11, we get 330 &divide; 11 = 30 with no remainder at all, which is an equivalent way of saying the ISBN-10 is legit! Stated more formally, 0 &equiv; 330 (mod 11)!

Hopefully those exclamation points make the math more exciting.

So, computing this check digit's not hard, but it does get a bit tedious by hand. Let's write a program.

Create a file called `isbn.c` inside `~/workspace/unit1/isbn`, in which you should write a program that prompts the user for an ISBN-10 and then reports (via `printf`) whether the number's legit. So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program's last line of output be either `YES\n` or `NO\n`, nothing more, nothing less.

For simplicity, you may assume that the user's input will be exactly ten decimal digits (i.e., devoid of hyphens and `X`), the first of which might even be zero(es), as in the case of our recommended book. But do not assume that the user's input will fit in an `int`! Recall, after all, that the largest value that can fit in an `int` is 2^32^ - 1 = 4,294,967,295 (and, even then, only if declared as `unsigned`). True, that's a 10-digit value, but there might still be a problem. (What?) Best to be safe and use `get_long` from CS50's library to get users' input. (Why?)

Okay, so you've gotten some input. What should you do? Well, realize that this C program, not unlike Scratch projects, can be reduced to the most basic of building blocks. For the sake of discussion, suppose that some variable `x` contains a 10-digit `long long` (with no leading zeroes). How can you get at its tenth (i.e., rightmost) digit? Well how about this?

[source,c]
----
int tenth = x % 10;
----

Do you see why that works? Do not pass Go until it dawns on you why!

How, now, can you get at that same variable's ninth digit? Well, why don't we first get rid of its tenth digit by shifting every other one place to the right?

[source,c]
----
x = x / 10;
----

How about that trick? Do you see why it works? The ninth digit, now, is just:

[source,c]
----
int ninth = x % 10;
----

So we bet there's a pattern here. And odds are you don't need to (i.e., shouldn't) copy/paste lines like the above nine or ten times. Loops are your friend. To be sure, other approaches exist.
Proceed as you wish! Perhaps some of these tricks, though, will get you started.

To compile your program, type

[source,bash]
----
make isbn
----

Assuming your program compiled without errors (or, ideally, warnings) via either command, run your program with the command below.

[source,bash]
----
./isbn
----

Consider the below representative of how your own program should behave when passed a valid ISBN-10 (sans hyphens); underlined is some user's input.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
~/workspace/unit1/isbn/ $ [underline]#./isbn#
ISBN: [underline]#0789751984#
YES
----

Of course, `get_long(“ISBN: “)` itself will reject an ISBN-10's hyphens (and more) anyway:

[source,subs=quotes]
----
~/workspace/unit1/isbn/ $ [underline]#./isbn#
ISBN: [underline]#0-789-75198-4#
Retry: [underline]#foo#
Retry: [underline]#0789751984#
YES
----

But it's up to you to catch inputs that are not ISBN-10s (e.g., Jenny'sfootnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny] phone number), even if ten digits.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
~/workspace/unit1/isbn/ $ [underline]#./isbn#
ISBN: [underline]#5558675309#
NO
----

== Testing

=== Correctness

Test out your program with a whole bunch of inputs, both valid and invalid. (We certainly will!) There are lots of valid ISBN-10s on http://www.amazon.com[amazon.com]. Of course, you should also test your program with `check50`:

[source,bash]
----
check50 cs50/problems/2018/ap/isbn
----

=== Style

[source]
----
style50 isbn.c
----

== Staff Solution

If your program behaves incorrectly on some inputs (or doesn't compile at all), have fun debugging! And if you'd like to play with the staff's own implementation of `isbn` on CS50 IDE, you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/unit1/isbn
----
