= Problem: Autocomplete

== tl;dr

Implement a program to autocomplete a user's input, per the below:

[source, subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#./autocomplete Computer#
computer
computerese
[...]
computer's
----

include::../../honesty.adoc[]

== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along three axes primarily.

Correctness::
 To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?
Design::
 To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?
Style::
 To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Getting Started

Start off by opening up CS50 IDE and then type

[source,bash]
----
update50
----

within a terminal window to make sure your workspace is up-to-date. Next, navigate to your `workspace/unitA` directory and execute the following:

[source,bash]
----
wget http://docs.cs50.net/2018/ap/problems/autocomplete/autocomplete.zip
----

Unzip that directory and navigate inside your newly created `autocomplete` directory. If you list the contents of your directory, you should see the following:

[source,bash]
----
Makefile  autocomplete.c  autocomplete.h  large.txt  small.txt  trie.c  trie.h
----

Make sure to watch the following shorts before you trie... err, __try__ this problem. Here are Doug and Kevin on tries:

All right, here we go!

== History Lesson

Back in the days before smartphones, sending a text message actually used to be comparatively quite the ordeal. Though you may not pay much attention to them anymore, have you noticed that on telephones the number keys also have several letters on them?

image::keypad.png[Telephone keypad]

For instance, on the above layout the digit `2` apparently also represents the letters `A`, `B`, and `C`.footnote:[The letters were primarily used as a mnemonic device, generally for business who wished to have a phone number that was memorable for their customers. A somewhat commonly-known example of this even today in the United States and Canada would be the phone number 1-800-356-9377, better known as __1-800-FLOWERS__.] And these letters formed the first standard that cell phone manufacturers settled on for inputting letters in text messages. If you wanted to type an `A` you pressed the `2` key once. If you wanted to type an `S` you pressed the `7` key four times. If you wanted to type an `N` followed by an `O`, you pressed the `6` key twice, waited for the `N` to be locked in, then pressed the `6` key three more times.

Needless to say, sending a text message was quite a bit slower.

Another method soon became quite common, known as the __Text on 9 Keys__ standard (T9). When sending a text message using T9, you would hit each number key you needed to hit as if it was the only letter on that key, and the software would algorithmically determine the most likely word you were trying to type. For example, if you wanted to type the word `HELLO`, you would enter `43556` on your mobile device. If you wanted to type the word `COMPUTER`, you would enter `26678837`. T9 was pretty smart, too; if you mistyped a key (for instance typing `36678837` instead), it would still algorithmically determine that you probably meant `COMPUTER` instead of, say `DOMPUTER` or `FOMPUTER`.

This was quite a bit faster, but not without its own issues. The most common problem was that a number of pairs of words have exactly the same set of key presses. For instance, if `42637` was entered, did the sender mean `GAMES` or `HANDS`? Unlike more modern devices, which usually consider context, T9 simply made a guess. Depending on the cell phone being used, there was then either an option to cycle through a list of words with the same T9 code to find the one intended, or in the worst case the user would have to revert to the "old school" method, turning T9 off temporarily to manually punch in the word one letter at a time.

Now, of course, smartphones just pull up a miniature version of a standard QWERTY (or local equivalent) keyboard, and rely on a large built-in dictionary and context from words previously typed to anticipate the word presently being entered, automatically completing your thoughts for you.footnote:[Don't worry, the singularity is probably still a while off. Probably.]

Autocompletion. Hey, that sounds like a fun problem to tackle!

== Trie This

The goal of this problem is to implement a form of autocompletion via the command line, relying upon a dictionary of words that we provide which have been meaningfully (and deliberately!) organized into a familiar data structure, the **trie**. By properly navigating that trie, it is possible to find all words in the dictionary beginning with a particular set of letters. (Perhaps Doug and Kevin's videos above can inspire you as to how one might do this!)

For example, if we run our finished `autocomplete` using the dictionary file called `large.txt`, searching for all words that begin with the string `help`, we should see output like the following (wherein underlined text represents user input):

[source,bash,subs=quotes]
----
~/workspace/unitA/autocomplete/ $ [underline]#./autocomplete large.txt help#
help
helped
helper
helpers
helpful
helpfully
helpfulness
helping
helpless
helplessly
helplessness
helpmann
helpmate
helpmeet
helps
----

Those are all the words in the chosen dictionary file (`large.txt`) that start with the letters `help`. For those interested in learning more about Linux commands, the utility `grep` (globally search a regular expression and print) also can do this. If you

[source,bash]
----
grep ^help[a-z]* large.txt
----

you should see an identical list of words. An explanation of how `grep` works and what a regular expression (such as `^help[a-z]pass:[*]`) is, however, goes well beyond the scope of this course!

How should you start? We'd recommend perusing what we've already done for you!

First take a peek at `trie.h`, where we've defined a few globals and constants for this problem. We give you, for instance, defined constants for the maximum length of a word (`LENGTH`), the default dictionary if the user does not provide one (`DICTIONARY`), the number of children each node of the trie has (`CHILDREN`), and the ASCII value of the apostrophe character (`APOSTROPHE`). We also define what each node of the trie looks like, and globally define a pointer to the root of the trie we'll construct. Lastly, we provide prototypes for a few functions.

Now open up `trie.c`, which is where we provide the implementation for those function we've prototyped in `trie.h`. The `load` function opens up a dictionary text file and loads it into a trie data structure for you, setting up all the pointers and everything. (Phew!) The `map` function simply determines what index of the `children` array in each node that a letter corresponds to. For example, `A` and `a` map to 0, `B` and `b` map to 1, and so on. Because apostrophes are also a valid character, they map to the final element in that array, 26 (`CHILDREN - 1`). Notice the use of the ternary operator (`?:`) here; we've deliberately included it to show you how it can simply a more complex conditional branching structure and make code look quite a bit more elegant.

Make sure you understand how `load` works, as you'll have to use the information we store there later!

Now head over to `autocomplete.c`. Note that we've also set up `main` and dealt with managing the command line arguments for you. But it does seem as though we've neglected to complete the implementation of two important functions: `autocomplete` and `unload`! Note also that `main` has been configured to ultimately return what `autocomplete` returns, so if (when) you implement any error checking, you should have `autocomplete` return a nonzero value (as we typically have `main` return when something has gone awry) or, if you get all the way to the end, you should probably have `autocomplete` return 0!

You are also in charge of unloading the trie, freeing all the memory we kindly malloced for you over in `trie.c`.

== Recursing the Heavens

Recall from the shorts that whenever you need to index through a trie, you must do it recursively. As a result, you may find it most helpful to write some helper functions for both `autocomplete` and `unload`, as the declarations for each that we provide atop `autocomplete.c` should not be altered.

To make debugging via `gdb` easier, we've included a smaller dictionary, `small.txt`. To run the program with this smaller file, simply use `small.txt` as the second command line argument, after `./autocomplete` and before the letters you want to use as the basis for your autocompletion.

== A Trieing Experience

When all is said and done, your program should:

* Output all the words in the dictionary that start with the provided letters.
** You may not assume that the provided letters will be only either lowercase letters or the apostrophe character, and accordingly should be prepared to detect and deal with that error.
* Correctly recognize, and inform the user, if there are no words that start with the given letters, without the program crashing.
* Have no memory leaks and no memory usage errors when run through `valgrind`.

Be certain that at no point in your work on this problem that you modify either `trie.c` or `trie.h` (though you are welcome and indeed encouraged to look through those two files!). All of your work should be on making changes to either `autocomplete.c` and/or `autocomplete.h`.

This was Autocomplete.
