== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along three axes primarily.

Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Getting Started

First, log into https://cs50.io/[cs50.io]. Then, execute

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/workspace/unit3
----

at your prompt to ensure that you're inside of `unit3` (which is inside of `workspace` which is inside of your home directory). Then execute

[source,bash]
----
wget http://docs.cs50.net/2018/ap/problems/scramble/scramble.zip
----

to download this problem's distro. Unzip the ZIP file (remember how?) and then delete the ZIP file from your `unit3` directory. Navigate into your newly-created `scramble` directory (remember how?) and type:

[source,bash]
----
ls
----

You should see that your directory contains two files.

[source,bash]
----
scramble.c  words.txt
----

== Scramblin'

Scramble wasfootnote:[The game is probably more commonly known--as of this writing--as "Word Streak with Friends".] a game, popular on smartphones, that challenges you to find as many words as possible in a 4x4 grid of letters before a timer expires. Each pair of letters in a word can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Below, for instance, is what the modern version of the game looks like on an Android phone.

Present are words like `THIS`, `SING`, `GEAR`, `HIS`, `RED`, along with many other words.

In your terminal prompt, execute:

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/unit3/scramble
----

in order to try out the staff's implementation of `scramble`. You should see a 4x4 grid filled with letters. As soon as you spot a word, type it and hit Enter. If it's indeed a word in the grid (and in a dictionary of English words), your score will increase 1 point for each letter in the word. (Good job!) By default, you'll have 30 seconds to find as many words as you can. You won't see the clock ticking, but each time you input a word, you'll see how many seconds you have left. As soon as time's run out, you'll be allowed to type one last word. (To quit the game early, hit ctrl-c.)

Now execute again:

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/unit3/scramble
----

Odds are the grid of letters changed? That's because the distribution code uses `rand`. But what if you don't want the grid's letters to change each time you run `scramble`, particularly while debugging? No problem, simply execute

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/unit3/scramble 1
----

to play grid #1, or

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/unit3/scramble 2
----

to play grid #2, etc. That otherwise optional command-line arguments will be used as a "seed" for `rand` in order to perturb its output.

== Perusin'

Time to take a break from playing! Open up `scramble.c`. The challenge at hand in this problem is to complete this game's implementation. But first, let's take a tour.

Notice first that atop `scramble.c` are a bunch of constants. Take note of the comments above each. Recall that declaring as constants values that you intend to use multiple times throughout
your code tends to be good practice, so that you can change the value as needed in a single place.

Next, below those constants are some global variables. Global variables tend to be frowned upon (because there's usually a cleaner way to achieve some goal). But when the sole purpose of a file is to implement some program, as is the case here with `scramble.c`, it's not unreasonable to use globals to avoid passing around particularly important values again and again among several functions. For instance, we've declared `grid` as a global simply because so many functions will need access to it anyway, as you'll eventually see.

Notice next how we've utilized `typedef` and `struct` (both of which are quite new!) to declare our very own data type called `word`, inside of which is a `bool` and an array. We'll use a whole bunch of those structures in order to keep track of the words in that dictionary you downloaded (and whether the user has found them on the grid). Soon enough, we'll learn more about the `struct` keyword and how to create our own data types. For now, take for granted that it's possible, and consider it a sneak preview of things to come.

Below `word`, meanwhile, is `dictionary`, which we've declared as a `struct` without using `typedef`. The result is that this program will have just one `dictionary` structure, inside of which is an `int` and an array of many elements of type `word`.

Consider the prototypes below `dictionary` a sneak preview of the functions to come!

Incidentally, take care not to change any code related to `logfile`, which we use to automate some tests of your code!

Next read through `main`, focusing first on the comments and then on the code. If unsure at first glance what some line does, take some time to figure it out. It'll be a lot easier to write new
code if you understand the code that's already there! If unfamiliar with some function, try to find it on CS50 Reference, else consult its "man page."

For instance, to pull up the manual for `atoi`, execute the below.footnote:[On occasion, you may need to execute `man 2 function` or `man 3 function`, where `function` is some function's name, lest you pull up the manual for a Linux command as opposed to a C function. For instance, the `man` page for C's `printf` is in (chapter) 3 and not 1, which is the default if you don't specify a chapter explicitly.]

[source,bash]
----
man atoi
----

Notice, incidentally, how we're utilizing some "ANSI color codes" in main in order to output red text when the game's timer expires. They're a bit cryptic, to be sure, but pretty easy to use. See http://pueblo.sourceforge.net/doc/manual/ansi_color_codes.html[this link] for other colors.

Also, while debugging your program, you might want to comment out the call to `clear` in `main` so that you can see everything printed by `printf`, without anything disappearing.

Next read through each of the functions below `main`. Don't fret if you don't understand `find` and `crawl`, but do take a stab at reading through them. It turns out that `crawl` implements a
"recursive" algorithm (whereby `crawl` calls itself) that searches the grid horizontally, vertically, and diagonally for a particular word, "marking" letters temporarily as it visits them so that it doesn't accidentally get caught in an infinite loop.

Meanwhile, `initialize` might look a bit intimidating, but spend some time figuring out how it goes about initializing the grid with a distribution of letters. The `man` page for `rand` (albeit a bit cryptic itself) might help you figure out all the arithmetic.

Finally, `load` definitely has some new syntax, particularly `FILE`. We'll revisit `FILE` and more in the weeks to come. For now, know that `load` simply loads a whole bunch of words, one per line, from a file into an array.

Hm, it seems we forgotfootnote:[Has the conceit of us "forgetting" to do certain things gotten old yet?] to implement `draw`, `lookup`, and `scramble`. Oops!

== Codin'

Suffice it to say we need your help finishing this implementation of `scramble`! And just a couple other favors, too, if you don't mind!

* Complete the implementation of `draw` (using some loops and `printf`) in such a way that `grid[i][j]` represents the letter in row `i`, column `j`. You're welcome to stray from the aesthetics of the staff's own solution.
* Complete the implementation of `lookup` in such a way that the function returns `true` if and only if `word` is in `dictionary`. Odds are you can do better than linear search. Be sure to also mark the word's `found` attribute to be `true` also, to prevent users from scoring the same word multiple times!
* Complete the implementation of `scramble` (the function) in such a way that the grid is **rotated** 90 degrees clockwise anytime the user types ``SCRAMBLE``, per the comments therein.  Note that this feature doesn't affect the words in the grid; it simply lets the user see them from different perspective.
* By default, the distribution code is case-sensitive, whereby if `FOO` is in dictionary, the user must type `FOO`, not `foo`, in order to score. Alter `main` in such a way that the user can
type `FOO` or `foo` (or even `FoO` or any other capitalization thereof) in order to score.

Now you can play (well, maybe after some debugging) your own version of `scramble`!
