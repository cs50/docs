== Help

* Attend your TF's *section* (or another if you have an unavoidable conflict).
* Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).
* Post questions and search answers in https://discourse.cs50.net/c/cs50-2018[*CS50 Discourse*].
* Attend https://cs50.harvard.edu/2018/fall/hours[*office hours*].
