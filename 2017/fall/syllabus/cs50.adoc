= CS50 Syllabus

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. 68% of CS50 students have never taken CS before.

This course meets on Fridays, 10am-12pm, starting September 1. The course also meets on one Wednesday, September 6, 1pm-2:30pm. Students without conflicts are encouraged to attend all lectures in person this year; students with conflicts may watch later online. Students may simultaneously enroll in CS50 and another course that meets at the same time. To do so, students should enroll in the other course via my.harvard.edu and then email enrollment@fas.harvard.edu to have CS50 manually added to their crimson carts as well. CS50 is ordinarily graded SAT/UNS, though students taking CS50 to fulfill old Gen Ed requirements or whose concentration requires letter grades should change their grading status to letter-graded via my.harvard by the term's fifth Monday. First years may take both CS50 and a freshman seminar SAT/UNS.  All students are expected to attend an orientation meeting in Science Center D on either September 6, 5:30pm-6:30pm, or September 7, 3pm-4pm; students with conflicts may watch later online. See cs50.harvard.edu for FAQs. Required sections to be arranged.

== Grades

CS50 is ordinarily graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (SAT/UNS), much like freshman seminars and some tutorials, though students taking CS50 to fulfill old Gen Ed requirements or whose concentration requires letter grades should change their grading status to letter-graded via https://my.harvard.edu/[my.harvard] by the term's fifth Monday. Even though first years may not ordinarily enroll in both a Freshman Seminar and another non-letter-graded course in any one term, they may take both CS50 and a Freshman Seminar SAT/UNS.

Whether taking the course SAT/UNS or for a letter grade, you must ordinarily submit all nine problem sets, take one test and one quiz, and submit a final project in order to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

Final grades are determined using the following weights:

|===
| Problem Sets | 45%
| Test | 25%
| Quiz | 15%
| Final Project| 10%
| Engagement | 5%
|===

Problem sets and the final project are evaluated along axes of correctness, design, and style, with scores ordinarily computed as 3 × correctness + 2 × design + 1 × style. Engagement takes into account participation in sections, office hours, and/or the course's online discussion forum. Scores are normalized across teaching fellows and comfort levels at term's end, so mid-semester comparisons among students of scores are not reliable indicators of standing. 

Know that CS50 draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those less comfortable," "those more comfortable," and those somewhere in between. However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you, in Week 11, end up relative to yourself in Week 0.

Each student's final grade is individually determined at term's end. Remarkable effort and upward trending are considered, as is input from the teaching fellows. The course does not have pre-determined cutoffs for final grades. The course is not graded on a curve. Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are not at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those more comfortable.

== Simultaneous Enrollment

Ordinarily, you may not enroll in courses that meet at the same time or overlapping times. However, you may enroll in CS50 and another course whose meetings overlap fully or partially with CS50. To do so, enroll in the other course via http://my.harvard.edu/[my.harvard.edu], and then email enrollment@fas.harvard.edu to have CS50 manually added to your Crimson Cart as well. You do not need anyone's permission or signature, and you do not need to petition the Administrative Board.

== Office Hours 

Office hours are opportunities for help with problem sets alongside the course's teaching fellows and course assistants. 

A schedule of office hours appears on the course's website.

== Tutoring

For students who avail themselves of the course's other resources but still find themselves struggling, the course offers tutoring, to the extent possible, providing opportunities for students to work with the course's staff one-on-one or in particularly small groups. To arrange, contact the course's heads.

== Problem Sets

Nine problem sets are assigned during the semester. Late work is not ordinarily accepted, except in cases of emergency. 

A schedule of problem sets appears below.

|===
| Problem Set | Language | Released | Due

| Problem Set 0 | Scratch | Fri 9/1 | Tue 9/5, noon
| Problem Set 1 | C | Wed 9/6 | Mon 9/11, noon
| Problem Set 2 | C | Mon 9/11 | Mon 9/18, noon
| Problem Set 3 | C | Fri 9/15 | Mon 9/25, noon
| Problem Set 4 | C | Fri 9/22 | Mon 10/2, noon
| Problem Set 5 | C | Fri 9/29 | Mon 10/9, noon
| Problem Set 6 | Python | Fri 10/20 | Mon 10/30, noon
| Problem Set 7 | Python, SQL | Fri 10/27 | Mon 11/6, noon
| Problem Set 8 | JavaScript | Fri 11/3 | Mon 11/13, noon
|===

== Test

|===
| Released        | Due

| Fri 10/13, noon | Mon 10/16, noon
|===

Due by noon on Mon 10/16 is a take-home test that will cover Weeks 0 through 5 (and Problem Sets 0 through 5). The test is open-book: you may use any and all non-human resources during the test, but the only humans to whom you may turn for help or from whom you may receive help are the course's heads.

== Quiz

|===
| Released       | Due

| Tue 11/14, noon | Thu 11/16, noon
|===

Due by noon on Thu 11/16 is a take-home quiz that will cover Weeks 0 through 10 (and Problem Sets 0 through 8), with emphasis on Week 6 (and Problem Set 6) onward. The quiz is open-book: you may use any and all non-human resources during the quiz, but the only humans to whom you may turn for help or from whom you may receive help are the course's heads.

== Final Project

The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course's lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to the staff's approval. You may implement your project in any language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize any infrastructure, provided the staff ultimately has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact campus, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.

Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates for this final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group's project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person group's project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course's problem sets. Although no more than three students may design and implement a given project, you are welcome to solicit advice from others, so long as you respect the course's policy on academic honesty.

Extensions on the final project are not ordinarily granted, except in cases of emergency. Lateness of submissions is determined down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent to not submitting at all.

| Milestone | Date

| Pre-Proposal | Fri 10/27, noon
| Proposal | Fri 11/10, noon
| Status Report | Mon 11/27, noon
| CS50 Hackathon | Thu 11/30, 7pm – Fri 12/1, 7am
| Implementation | Thu 12/7, noon

|===

== CS50 Hackathon

From 7pm on Thu 11/30 until 7am on Fri 12/1 is the CS50 Hackathon, an epic all-nighter during which you can dive into your final project's implementation alongside classmates (from Harvard and Yale alike!) and staff. If you choose to partake, you'll be asked to propose three milestones for yourself that evening: a "good" one that you intend to achieve no matter what; a "better" one that you think you can achieve; and a "best" one that you hope to achieve.

Dinner will be served around 9pm, second dinner will be served around 1am, and those still standing around 5am will be treated to breakfast at IHOP.

== CS50 Fair

From 11am until 4:30pm on Fri 12/8 is the CS50 Fair, an epic display of final projects. Not only is the CS50 Fair a venue at which to see classmates' projects and demo your own, it is an opportunity to mingle with students, faculty, and staff from across campus as well as recruiters from industry. Attendance is expected of all students.

Also in attendance are popcorn, candy, and a raffle with (fabulous) prizes. Family and friends are welcome to join.

== Financial Aid

CS50 does not require that students purchase any books, hardware, or sofware. While not required, having one's own laptop is helpful, particularly for office hours. Students without their own laptops are encouraged to reach out at term's start to the course's instructor to discuss possibilities.
