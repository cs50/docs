= CS50 Syllabus


Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and to the art of programming. Students learn how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. See CS50's website, https://cs50.yale.edu, for additional information.

No previous programming experience required. Open to students of all levels and majors.

CS50 officially meets on Thursdays, from 4pm until 5:15pm in Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall (SSS) Room 114, but students are only expected to attend in person the course's first lecture on Thursday 8/31, mid-semester lecture on Thursday 10/12, and final lecture on Thursday 11/16. If you have a time conflict with any of those lectures, you should watch the recordings instead.  Required sections to be arranged.

== Grades

You are encouraged to take CS50 Credit/D/Fail if you will feel less nervous without the pressure of a letter grade.  Note however, that Freshman are generally discouraged from taking classes Credit/D/Fail in their first term, and it will only satisfy the QR requirement if you take it for a grade.  Please also remember that your course grade will reflect how much *you* progress over the semester.  We expect you to work hard and learn a lot, and your course grades will reflect that.

Whether taking the course Credit/D/Fail or for a letter grade, you must ordinarily submit all nine problem sets, take one test and one quiz, and submit a final project in order to be eligible for a passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads. Graduate and professional students are expected to produce a final project that is 50% greater in scope than what is expected of undergraduate students.

Final grades are determined using the following weights:

|===
| Problem Sets | 45%
| Test | 25%
| Quiz | 15%
| Final Project| 10%
| Engagement | 5%
|===

Problem sets and the final project are evaluated along axes of correctness, design, and style, with scores ordinarily computed as 3 × correctness + 2 × design + 1 × style. Engagement takes into account participation in sections, office hours, and/or the course's online discussion forum. Scores are normalized across teaching assistants and comfort levels at term's end, so mid-semester comparisons among students of scores are not reliable indicators of standing. 

Know that CS50 draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those less comfortable," "those more comfortable," and those somewhere in between. However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you, in Week 11, end up relative to yourself in Week 0.

Each student's final grade is individually determined at term's end. Remarkable effort and upward trending are considered, as is input from the teaching assistants. The course does not have pre-determined cutoffs for final grades. The course is not graded on a curve. Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are not at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those more comfortable.

== Lectures

CS50 officially meets on Thursdays, from 4pm until 5:15pm in Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall (SSS) Room 114, but students are only        expected to attend in person the course's first lecture on Thursday 8/31, mid-semester lecture on Thursday 10/12, and final lecture on Thursday 11/16. If you've a conflict, though, you're welcome to watch those lectures online.


Other lectures are live-streamed from Harvard on Fridays, though you're welcome to watch on demand anytime thereafter. On Thursdays, CS50 holds "enrichment" in SSS 114 for students who would like additional context and depth on some of the topics covered in class.  Attendance is optional, but encouraged if you do not have a conflict.  Because these will not be "review" or "help" sessions, you will not be at any disadvantage if you are unable to attend.

A schedule of lectures, subject to change, appears below.

== Sections

Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 90-minute sections led by the teaching assistants. Different sections are offered for those less comfortable, those more comfortable, and those somewhere in between. You will sign up for a section in the Online Course Selection system starting Wed. 9/6 at 9:00am.  The times and distribution of comfort levels is based on the preferences many of you entered in the preference selection system.

Attendance at section is expected up until the test.

== Office Hours 

Office hours are opportunities for help with problem sets alongside the course's teaching assistants and course assistants.

A schedule of office hours appears on the course's website.

Each week, the instructors will offer additional time to discuss any and all of students' questions, comments, and concerns about the course or computer science more generally. These dates and times will appear on the aforementioned schedule.

== Tutoring

For students who avail themselves of the course's other resources but still find themselves struggling, the course offers tutoring, to the extent possible, providing opportunities for students to work with the course's staff one-on-one or in particularly small groups. To arrange, contact the course's heads.

== Problem Sets

Nine problem sets are assigned during the semester. Late work is not ordinarily accepted, except with a Dean's excuse.  (Graduate students should e-mail heads@cs50.yale.edu as early as possible to request an extension.)

A schedule of problem sets appears below.

|===
| Problem Set | Language | Released | Due

| Problem Set 0 | Scratch | Thu 8/31 | Tue 9/5, noon
| Problem Set 1 | C | Wed 9/6 | Mon 9/11, noon
| Problem Set 2 | C | Mon 9/11 | Mon 9/18, noon
| Problem Set 3 | C | Fri 9/15 | Mon 9/25, noon
| Problem Set 4 | C | Fri 9/22 | Mon 10/2, noon
| Problem Set 5 | C | Fri 9/29 | Mon 10/9, noon
| Problem Set 6 | Python | Fri 10/20 | Mon 10/30, noon
| Problem Set 7 | Python, SQL | Fri 10/27 | Mon 11/6, noon
| Problem Set 8 | JavaScript | Fri 11/3 | Mon 11/13, noon

== Test

|===
| Released        | Due

| Fri 10/13, noon | Mon 10/16, noon
|===

Due by noon on Mon 10/16 is a take-home test that will cover Weeks 0 through 5 (and Problem Sets 0 through 5). The test is open-book: you may use any and all non-human resources during the test, but the only humans to whom you may turn for help or from whom you may receive help are the course's heads.

== Quiz

|===
| Released       | Due

| Tue 11/14, noon | Thu 11/16, noon
|===

Due by noon on Thu 11/16 is a take-home quiz that will cover Weeks 0 through 10 (and Problem Sets 0 through 8), with emphasis on Week 6 (and Problem Set 6) onward. The quiz is open-book: you may use any and all non-human resources during the quiz, but the only humans to whom you may turn for help or from whom you may receive help are the course's heads.

== Final Project

The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course's lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to the staff's approval. You may implement your project in any language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize any infrastructure, provided the staff ultimately has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact campus, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.

Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates for this final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group's project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person group's project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course's problem sets. Although no more than three students may design and implement a given project, you are welcome to solicit advice from others, so long as you respect the course's policy on academic honesty.

Extensions on the final project are not ordinarily granted, except in cases of emergency. A Dean's excuse is required.  Lateness of submissions is determined down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent to not submitting at all.

| Milestone | Date

| Pre-Proposal | Fri 10/27, noon
| Proposal | Fri 11/10, noon
| Status Report | Mon 11/27, noon
| CS50 Hackathon | Thu 11/30, 7pm – Fri 12/1, 7am

== CS50 Hackathon

From 7pm on Thu 11/30 until 7am on Fri 12/1 is the CS50 Hackathon, an epic all-nighter at Harvard during which you can dive into your final project's implementation alongside classmates (from Yale and Harvard alike!) and staff. If you choose to partake, you'll be asked to propose three milestones for yourself that evening: a "good" one that you intend to achieve no matter what; a "better" one that you think you can achieve; and a "best" one that you hope to achieve.

Dinner will be served around 9pm, second dinner will be served around 1am, and those still standing around 5am will be treated to breakfast at IHOP.

Transportation to and from the CS50 Hackathon will be provided.

== CS50 Fair

From 12pm until 3pm on Mon 12/11 is the CS50 Fair, an epic display of final projects. Not only is the CS50 Fair a venue at which to see classmates' projects and demo your own, it is an opportunity to mingle with students, faculty, and staff from across campus as well as recruiters from industry. Attendance is expected of all students.

Also in attendance are popcorn, candy, and a raffle with (fabulous) prizes. Family and friends are welcome to join.

== Financial Aid

CS50 does not require that students purchase any books, hardware, or sofware. While not required, having one's own laptop is helpful, particularly for office hours. Students without their own laptops are encouraged to reach out at term's start to the course's instructor and/or college dean to discuss possibilities.
