. Watch https://video.cs50.net/2016/fall/lectures/2[Week 2's lecture].
. Infer a user's initials from their name with `initials.c`.
. Choose two adventures:
+
--
* Implement Caesar's cipher.

+
. Submit your code.
. Submit a form.

== Help

For help with Week 2 and Problem Set 2:

* Watch Zamyla's walkthroughs herein.
* Start a https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/a7ec0c0a7b6e460f877da0734811c4cd/[discussion] with classmates.

== Reminders

Per https://video.cs50.net/2016/fall/lectures/2[Week 2's lecture]:

* Use `help50` as needed.
* Use `eprintf` as needed.
* Use `debug50` as needed.

== Getting Started

Alright, here we go again!

Log into https://cs50.io/[cs50.io] and execute

[source]
----
update50
----

within a terminal window to make sure your workspace is up-to-date. If you somehow closed your terminal window (and can't find it!), make sure that *Console* is checked under the *View* menu, then click the green, circled plus (+) in CS50 IDE's bottom half, then select *New Terminal*.

Next, execute

[source]
----
mkdir ~/workspace/pset2/
----

at your prompt in order to make a directory called `pset2` in your `workspace` directory. 

Now execute

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/
----

to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

[source]
----
~/workspace/pset2/ $
----

If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong. You can actually execute

[source,bash]
----
history
----

at the prompt to see your last several commands in chronological order if you'd like to do some sleuthing. You can also scroll through the same one line at a time by hitting your keyboard's up and down arrows; hit Enter to re-execute any command that you'd like. 

== What to Do

. Implement either of:
+
--
* link:../../../../problems/initials/less/initials.html[Initials], less comfortable
* link:../../../../problems/initials/more/initials.html[Initials], more comfortable
--
+
. Implement any two (2) of:
+
--
* link:../../../../problems/caesar/caesar.html[Caesar], less comfortable
* link:../../../../problems/vigenere/vigenere.html[Vigenere], less comfortable
* link:../../../../problems/crack/crack.html[Crack], more comfortable
--

== FAQs

=== Not a directory

If you execute, e.g.,

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/initials/
----

and see

[source]
----
bash: cd: /home/ubuntu/workspace/pset2/initials/: Not a directory
----

odds are you don't have a `pset2/` directory inside of `~/workspace/` and/or you don't have an `initials/` directory inside of `~/workspace/pset2/`. Check as much using `ls` (remember how?) or poke around your IDE's file browser at left. Make sure that:

* you have a `pset2/` directory inside of `~/workspace/`,
* you have an `initials/` directory inside of `~/workspace/pset2/`, inside of which is `initials.c`,
* you have an `caesar/` directory inside of `~/workspace/pset2/`, inside of which is `caesar.c`,
* you have an `vigenere/` directory inside of `~/workspace/pset2/`, inside of which is `vigenere.c`, and/or
* you have an `crack/` directory inside of `~/workspace/pset2/`, inside of which is `crack.c`.

== How to Submit

Be sure you've signed up for a https://github.com/join[GitHub account], per Problem Set 0, and that you've logged into and authorized https://cs50.me/[CS50.me] at least once, per Problem Set 1!

=== Step 1 of 4

Execute `update50` again to ensure that your IDE is up-to-date.

=== Step 2 of 4

* Recall that you were asked to implement the less-comfortable or more-comfortable version of `initials`. 
** Be sure that `initials.c` is in `~/workspace/pset2/initials/`, as with:
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/initials/
ls
----
* Recall that you were asked to implement any two (2) of `caesar`, `vigenere`, and `crack`.
** If you implemented `caesar`, be sure that `caesar.c` is in `~/workspace/pset2/caesar/`.
** If you implemented `vigenere`, be sure that `vigenere.c` is in `~/workspace/pset2/vigenere/`.
** If you implemented `crack`, be sure that `crack.c` is in `~/workspace/pset2/crack/`.

=== Step 3 of 4

* To submit the less-comfortable version of `initials` (if you implemented it), execute
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/initials/
submit50 cs50/2017/x/initials/less
----
+
inputting your GitHub username and GitHub password as prompted.
* To submit the more-comfortable version of `initials` (if you implemented it), execute
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/initials/
submit50 cs50/2017/x/initials/more
----
+
inputting your GitHub username and GitHub password as prompted.
* To submit `caesar` (if you implemented it), execute:
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/caesar/
submit50 cs50/2017/x/caesar
----
* To submit `vigenere` (if you implemented it), execute:
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/vigenere/
submit50 cs50/2017/x/vigenere
----
* To submit `crack` (if you implemented it), execute:
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/pset2/crack/
submit50 cs50/2017/x/crack
----

If you run into any trouble, email sysadmins@cs50.harvard.edu!

You may resubmit any problem as many times as you'd like.

=== Step 4 of 4
  
Submit https://forms.cs50.net/2017/x/psets/2[this form]!
 
Your submission should be graded within 2 minutes, at which point your score will appear at https://cs50.me/[cs50.me]!

This was Problem Set 2.
