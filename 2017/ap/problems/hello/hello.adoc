= Problem: Hello

Questions?  Feel free to head to https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50[CS50 on Reddit], http://cs50x.slack.com[the CS50x Slack page], http://cs50.stackexchange.com[CS50 on StackExchange], or the https://www.facebook.com/groups/cs50[CS50 Facebook group].

Don't be alarmed by the length of this problem's specification. Most of it is just instructions for getting your programming environment set up and learning how to navigate within it. Once these steps are completed, you'll be good to go for the rest of the year in CS50 AP!

== tl;dr

Implement a program that prints out a simple greeting to the user, per the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#./hello#
Hello, world!
----

== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope::
  To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?
Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?
Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?
Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Getting Started

Recall that CS50 IDE is a web-based "integrated development environment" that allows you to program "in the cloud," without installing any software locally. Underneath the hood is a popular operating system, Ubuntu Linux, that’s been "containerized" with open-source software called Docker, that allows multiple users (like you!) to share the operating system’s "kernel" (its nucleus, so to speak) and files, even while having files of their own. Indeed, CS50 IDE provides you with your very own "workspace" (i.e., storage space) in which you can save your own files and folders (aka directories).

After all, wouldn't you like to get programming right away, without having to download, install, or configure much of anything at all?

=== Logging In

Head to https://cs50.io/[cs50.io] and log into CS50 IDE, selecting *edX* from the drop-down menu when prompted.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you typically sign into https://courses.edx.org/login[edX] via Facebook, Google, or Microsoft, you'll first need to create a password for your edX account as follows:

. Sign into your edX account at https://courses.edx.org/login[courses.edx.org/login] (via Facebook, Google, or Microsoft).
. Visit https://courses.edx.org/account/settings[courses.edx.org/account/settings].
. Click *Reset Your Password* (even though you don't yet have one) under *Password*.
. Check your email for a message from edX. (If it hasn't arrived after a few minutes, do check your spam folder.) Click the link in that message to reset (i.e., create) your password.
. Log into https://cs50.io/[cs50.io]!
====

Upon logging into CS50 IDE for the first time, you may be prompted (again) for your email address. If so, after providing it, click *Private* under *Hosted workspace*, then click *Create workspace*.

You should then be informed that CS50 IDE (aka Cloud9, the software that underlies CS50 IDE) is "creating your workspace" and "creating your container," which might take a moment. You should eventually see your workspace, which should resemble mine from Week 1. If not, do just email the course's heads to inquire!

=== Updating

Toward the bottom of CS50 IDE's UI is a "terminal window" (light blue, by default), a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to explore your workspace's files and directories, compile code, run programs, and even install new software. You should find that its "prompt" resembles the below.

[source,text]
----
~/workspace/ $
----

Click inside of that terminal window and then type

[source,text]
----
update50
----

followed by Enter to ensure that your workspace is up-to-date. It might take a few minutes for any updates to complete. (Be sure not to close the tab or CS50 IDE itself until they do!). 

=== Navigating CS50 IDE

Okay, let's create a folder (otherwise known as a *directory*) in which your code for this problem will soon live. On the left side of the screen you should see a file tree listing the current contents of your CS50 IDE workspace (right now it should simply be a folder entitled `~/workspace/`). Right-click in the blank space underneath that folder and select *New Folder* near the bottom of the context menu that pops up. This should create, as expected, a new folder for you entitled *New Folder* which you can rename now to `chapter1`. If you accidentally leave it named `New Folder`, simply right click on the folder, choose *Rename* from the context menu, and rename it. Inside `chapter1`, add another new folder named `hello`.

Front and center in the CS50 IDE workspace is a window wherein you'll be able to write your code, using Ace, a web-based text editor. Right now, assuming you haven't played around with the tabs, that window is blank.

Let's create a new file to play around with. Right-click on your newly-created `hello` folder and choose *New File* from the context menu. Then, double-click on this new file (which should hopefully be called `Untitled` and which should be nested beneath `hello` in the file tree), and a blank window should open up in Ace with the tab for `Untitled` as the active one.

Go ahead and type `hello` (or the ever-popular `asdf`) on line 1 of the document, and then notice how the tab's name now contains a red dot, indicating that you've made changes since the file was first opened. Select *File > Save*, and that red dot should turn green and then disappear, indicating all of our changes are saved.

`Untitled` isn't exactly a useful name for this file though, is it? Let's fix that! In the file tree on the left, right-click on `Untitled` and select *Rename* from the context menu. Enter `hello.txt` when able, and then hit Enter on your keyboard. You should see the name of the file has changed both in the file tree on the left and in the name of the tab.

Okay, with `hello.txt` still open in your workspace, notice that beneath your document is that terminal window. Notice that the window's prompt is, assuming you haven't otherwise manipulated it

[source]
----
~/workspace/ $
----

(where `~/workspace/`—i.e., inside a folder called `workspace` which is itself inside your home directory, the shorthand for which is `~`—is the directory you are currently in.) If that's the case, based on the file tree should be both a `chapter1` and a `hello` directory somewhere inside, since we created them just a few moments ago. Let's confirm as much.

Click somewhere inside of that terminal window and type

[source]
----
ls
----

and then Enter. That's a lowercase `L` and a lowercase `S`, which is shorthand notation for "list." Indeed, you should then see a list of the folders inside of your workspace directory, among which is `chapter1`! Let's open that folder! Type

[source]
----
cd chapter1
----

or even

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/chapter1/
----

followed by Enter to [underline]##c##hange your [underline]##d##irectory to `~/workspace/chapter1/` (ergo, `cd`). You should find that your prompt changes to

[source]
----
~/workspace/chapter1/ $
----

confirming that you are indeed now inside of `~/workspace/chapter1/` (i.e., a directory called `chapter1` inside of a directory called `workspace` inside of your home directory). Then type

[source]
----
cd hello
----

followed by Enter to enter into our directory `hello`. Now type

[source]
----
ls
----

followed by Enter. You should see `hello.txt`! Now, you can't click or double-click on that file's name there; it's just text. But that listing does confirm that `hello.txt` is where we hoped it would be.

Let's poke around a bit more. Go ahead and type

[source]
----
cd
----

and then Enter. It turns out that if you don't provide `cd` with a "command-line argument" (i.e., a directory's name), it whisks you back to the `~/workspace/` directory by default.

And indeed, your prompt should now be:

[source]
----
~/workspace/ $
----

Phew, home sweet home. Remember that everything we create in the CS50 IDE will ultimately live inside of `~/workspace/`.

Make sense? If not, no worries; it soon will! It's in this terminal window that you'll soon be compiling your first program! For now, though, close the tab by clicking the small "x" in the tab for `hello.txt` (if you've made additional changes, you'll be asked if you want to save your file before the tab closes).

== Specification

Shall we have you write your first program? Inside of your *hello* folder, create a new file called *hello.c*, and then open that file in a tab. (Remember how?) Be sure to name the file just as we have, in all lowercase; files' and folders' names in Linux are "case-sensitive." Proceed to write your first program by typing precisely these lines into the file:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
----

Notice how CS50 IDE adds "syntax highlighting" (i.e., color) as you type, though CS50 IDE's choice of colors might differ from this problem set's. Those colors aren't actually saved inside of the file itself; they're just added by CS50 IDE to make certain syntax stand out. Had you not saved the file as `hello.c` from the start, CS50 IDE wouldn't know (per the filename's extension) that you're writing C code, in which case those colors would be absent.

Do be sure that you type this program just right, else you're about to experience your first bug! In particular, capitalization matters, so don't accidentally capitalize words (unless they're between those two quotes). And don't overlook that one semicolon. C is quite nitpicky!

When done typing, select *File > Save* (or hit command- or control-s), but don't quit. Recall that the red dot atop the tab should then disappear. Click anywhere in the terminal window beneath your code, and be sure that you're inside of `~/workspace/chapter1/hello`. (Remember how? If not, type `cd` and then Enter, followed by `cd workspace/chapter1/hello/` and then Enter.) Your prompt should be:

[source,text]
----
~/workspace/chapter1/hello/ $
----

Let's confirm that `hello.c` is indeed where it should be. Type

[source,text]
----
ls
----

followed by Enter, and you should see `hello.c`? If not, no worries; you probably just missed a small step. Best to restart these past several steps or ask for help!

Assuming you indeed see `hello.c`, let's try to compile! Cross your fingers and then type

[source,text]
----
make hello
----

at the prompt, followed by Enter. (Well, maybe don't cross your fingers whilst typing.) To be clear, type only `hello` here, not `hello.c`. If all that you see is another, identical prompt, that means it worked! Your source code has been translated to object code (0s and 1s) that you can now execute. Type

[source,text]
----
./hello
----

at your prompt, followed by Enter, and you should see the below:

[source,text]
----
Hello, world!
----

And if you type

[source,text]
----
ls
----

followed by Enter, you should see a new file, `hello`, alongside `hello.c`. The first of those files, `hello`, should have an asterisk after its name that, in this context, means it's "executable," a program that you can execute (i.e., run).

If, though, upon running `make`, you instead see some error(s), it's time to debug! (If the terminal window's too small to see everything, click and drag its top border upward to increase its height.) If you see an error like "expected declaration" or something just as mysterious, odds are you made a syntax error (i.e., typo) by omitting some character or adding something in the wrong place. Scour your code for any differences vis-à-vis the template above. It's easy to miss the slightest of things when learning to program, so do compare your code against ours character by character; odds are the mistake(s) will jump out! Anytime you make changes to your own code, just remember to re-save via *File > Save* (or command- or control-s), then re-click inside of the terminal window, and then re-type

[source,text]
----
make hello
----

at your prompt, followed by Enter. (Just be sure that you are inside of `~/workspace/chapter1/hello/` within your terminal window, as your prompt will confirm or deny.) If still seeing errors, try "prepending" `help50` to your command like this:

[source,text]
----
help50 make hello
----

That'll pass the output of `make hello` to a program called `help50`, which CS50's staff wrote. If `help50` recognizes your error message, it'll offer some suggestions (in yellow). Just realize `help50` is new this year, so odds are it won't recognize all error messages just yet!

Once you see no more errors, try "executing" (i.e., running) your program by typing

[source,text]
----
./hello
----

at your prompt, followed by Enter! Hopefully you now see whatever you told `printf` to print?

If not, reach out for help!  Incidentally, if you find the terminal window too small for your tastes, know that you can open one in a bigger tab by clicking the circled plus (+) icon to the right of your `hello.c` tab.

== Walkthrough

video::vbkTzOytISY[youtube]

== Usage

Your program should behave per the example below. Assumed that the underlined text is what some user has typed.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#./hello#
Hello, world!
----

== Testing

=== `check50`

[source,text]
----
check50 cs50/2017/ap/hello
----

Assuming your program is correct, you should then see output like

[source,subs=quotes]
----
[green]#:) hello.c exists#
[green]#:) hello.c compiles#
[green]#:) prints "Hello, world!\n"#
----

where each green smiley means your program passed a check (i.e., test). You may also see a URL at the bottom of ``check50``'s output, but that's just for staff (though you're welcome to visit it).

If you instead see yellow or red smileys, it means your code isn't correct! For instance, suppose you instead see the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
[red]#:( hello.c exists#
  \ expected hello.c to exist
[yellow]#:| hello.c compiles#
  \ can't check until a frown turns upside down
[yellow]#:| prints "Hello, world!\n"#
  \ can't check until a frown turns upside down
----

Because `check50` doesn't think `hello.c` exists, as per the red smiley, odds are you uploaded the wrong file or misnamed your file. The other smileys, meanwhile, are yellow because those checks are dependent on `hello.c` existing, and so they weren't even run.

Suppose instead you see the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
[green]#:) hello.c exists#
[green]#:) hello.c compiles#
[red]#:( prints "Hello, world!\n"#
  \ expected output, but not "Hello, world!"
----

Odds are, in this case, you printed something other than `Hello, world!\n` verbatim, per the spec's expectations. In particular, the above suggests you printed `Hello, world!`, without a trailing newline (`\n`).

Know that `check50` won't actually record your scores in CS50's gradebook. Rather, it lets you check your work's correctness _before_ you submit your work. Once you actually submit your work (per the directions at this spec's end), CS50's staff will use `check50` to evaluate your work's correctness officially.

== Staff Solution

[source]
----
~cs50/chapter1/hello
----

== How to Submit

=== Step 1 of 2

Ensure that `hello.c` is in `~/workspace/chapter1`, as with:

[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/chapter1/
ls
----

If `hello.c` is not in `~/workspace/chapter1/`, move it into that directory, as via `mv` (or via CS50 IDE's lefthand file browser).

=== Step 2 of 2

* To submit `hello`, execute
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/chapter1/
submit50 cs50/2017/ap/hello
----
+

If you run into any trouble, email sysadmins@cs50.harvard.edu!

You may resubmit any problem as many times as you'd like before the deadline.
   
Your submission should be graded for correctness within 2 minutes, at which point your score will appear at https://cs50.me/[cs50.me]!

== Hints

Be sure to re-type (and not just copy and paste!) the code we've provided you above to get this program running. It'll be good to develop this muscle memory starting now!

This was Hello.
