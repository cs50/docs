== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope::
 To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?
Correctness::
 To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?
Design::
 To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?
Style::
 To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Getting Ready

First, say hello to Tommy, who's here to teach you a bit about some basic file input and output techniques using the command line.

Next, read up on two functions you'll probably want to know a thing or two about for this problem: `https://reference.cs50.net/stdlib/srand48[srand48]` and `https://reference.cs50.net/stdlib/drand48[drand48]`. `srand48` and `drand48` are similar in spirit to `srand` and `rand`, which you may recall using in http://docs.cs50.net/2016/ap/problems/skittles/skittles.html[Skittles], but perform their calculations using 48-bit arithmetic. Suffice it to say, given identical seeds, `rand` and `drand48` will generate different sets of pseudorandom numbers.

Before moving on, be sure you're comfortable answering the following questions:

** What is a "seed" to a random number generator (RNG)?
** Why do we describe the numbers generated by an RNG as __pseudorandom__ and not truly "random"?
** At the command line, what do `<` and `>` do, respectively?
** At the command line, what does `|` do?

== Getting Started

Enough reading and watching. Time for some coding! Log into your CS50 IDE at https://cs50.io/[cs50.io] and execute

[source,bash]
----
update50
----

within a terminal window to make sure your workspace is up-to-date.

If you somehow closed your terminal window (and can't find it!), make sure that *Console* is checked under the *View* menu, then click the green, circled plus (+) in CS50 IDE's bottom half, then select *New Terminal*.

Next, execute

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/workspace
----

at your prompt to ensure that you're inside of `workspace` (which is inside of your home directory). Then execute

[source,bash]
----
mkdir chapter3
----

to create a new `chapter3` directory instead of your workspace. Navigate inside of your `chapter3` directory, as with:

[source,bash]
----
cd chapter3
----

And then, once inside, create **another** directory inside of that one:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir rng
----

Then navigate into that folder (remember how?) and create a new file therein (remember how?) called `rng.c`. You're now ready to write a (pseudo)random number generator!

== Planting a Seed

In this program, you'll be implementing a program that allows the user to specify how many numbers they would like generated, each of which is capped at some maximum value, with the user optionally able to seed the generator with a seed of their choosing, otherwise relying on some other seed that is always changing, the canonical example being the current time. The user will be providing all of this information to you at the command line.

Notice the important keyword in the above paragraph: __optionally__. This program, unlike those you've written so far, can accept a variable number of command line arguments, and depending on how many command line arguments the user provides, you'll either seed the random number generator with the user-specified seed or with the current time.

In particular, this should be the correct use case of your program, and if the user does not adhere to this usage, you should exit the program (returning `1`) after informing the user of the correct usage.

[source,bash]
----
Usage: rng n max [s]
----

In general, we're going to take a hands-off approach here, as we'd like you to start muddling through some documentation to determine the correct way to use some built-in functions. But we will point out two things your program needs to do to conform to our specifications.

First, in order to use the `srand48` and `drand48` functions, you not only need to include the library specified in their manual pages, you also need to place the following line of code near the very top of your `rng.c` file:

[source,c]
----
#define _XOPEN_SOURCE
----

It turns out that sometimes it is not quite enough to `#include` a file to incorporate certain functions therein. Some functions, such as `srand48` and `drand48`, require you to also place in your program a so-called **feature test macro**. In CS50 AP, we don't particularly care what that means and won't elaborate on it (though you are welcome and encouraged to explore on your own!) The important takeaway here though is that we learned as much by perusing the manual pages for those functions and saw therein that we were required to `#define _XOPEN_SOURCE` (or `#define _SVID_SOURCE`, but conventionally in this course when we encounter the choice we will default to `_XOPEN_SOURCE`).

The other thing we would like you to do is to

[source,c]
----
#define LIMIT 65536
----

for reasons that have absolutely no relevance now, but rather is a setup for something in the future. Read to the end of the spec for more info! You should, however, exit your program (returning `1`), if `max` (provided by the user at the command line) exceeds the defined constant `LIMIT`, and of course should inform the user as to why your program has terminated.

== The Greatest Generation

As this program's usage suggests, this program expects two or three command-line arguments.  The first, `n`, is required; it indicates how many pseudorandom numbers you'd like to generate.  The second, `max`, is also required; it indicates the maximum possible value a number that is generated by your program can be (in other words, an "upper bound". The third argument `s`, is optional, as the brackets are meant to imply; if supplied, it represents the value that the pseudorandom-number generator should use as its "seed."  A seed is simply an input to a pseudorandom-number generator that influences its outputs.

For instance, if you seed `drand48` by first calling `srand48` with an argument of, say, `1`, and then call `drand48` itself three times, `drand48` might return `0.041630`, then `0.454492`, then `0.834817`. But if you instead seed `drand48` by first calling `srand48` with an argument of, say, `2`, and then call `drand48` itself three times, `drand48` might instead return `0.912433`, then `0.159083`, then `0.573263`.

But if you re-seed `drand48` by calling `srand48` again with an argument of `1`, the next three times you call `drand48`, you'll again get `0.041630`, then `0.454492`, then `0.834817`! See, not so random.

When compiled, `rng` should print out the numbers it generates, one per line, to the terminal window. But what if we wanted to save that list of numbers for whatever reason? We'll learn about some more rich techniques for "file I/O" in the coming chapter, but fortunately Linux has a very simple way of writing information more permanently to files. You can "redirect" `rng`'s terminal output to a file with a command like the below.

[source,bash]
----
./rng 1000 60000 > numbers.txt
----

We'll be using this feature soon enough!

== Hmm... Now What?

Incidentally, this program isn't terribly interesting. In fact, you're probably thinking that we've asked you to write more complex programs in Chapter 2 than what you've just written. Well, you'd be right. But this won't be the last time we see `rng`. Later on in this chapter, you'll be using the work you've done on this problem to help test out your solution to another problem. But more on that soon.

When ready to check the correctness of your program officially with `check50`... well, you can't. Reason being that the way the staff solution generates random numbers might in fact be different from your own, even though both do properly generate sets of random numbers. It's up to you to determine that your program produces:

* the correct number of pseudorandomly generated numbers,
* each of which is greater than or equal to 0 and also less than (and not equal to) `max`, and
* that if your program is run with the same seed value multiple times, the list of numbers it generates is identical from run to run.

Not having access to `check50` for this problem is actually a good thing. It's a bad idea to get into the habit of testing your code with `check50` before testing it yourself.  (And definitely don't get into an even worse habit of **only** testing your code with `check50`!)  Suffice it to say `check50` doesn't exist in the real world, so running your code with your own sample inputs, comparing actual output against expected output, is the best habit to get into sooner rather than later.

Truly, don't do yourself a long-term disservice!

Anyhow, if you'd like to play with the staff's own implementation of `rng` (which may generate a different set of numbers than your own implementation even given identical inputs, and that's okay!), you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/chapter3/rng

This was RNG.
