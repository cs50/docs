== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope::
 To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?
Correctness::
 To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?
Design::
 To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?
Style::
 To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== The Early Shift

First, have a look at a few shorts; in particular, these three on loops, command-line arguments, and the Caesar cipher. If you happen to see (and are confused by!) `char *` in these and other shorts, know for now that `char *` simply means `string`. But more on that soon!

Be sure you're reasonably comfortable answering the below questions before moving too far!

* How does a while loop differ from a do-while loop?  When is the latter particularly useful?
* Why is Caesar's cipher not very secure?
* What's a function?
* Why bother writing functions when you can just copy and paste code as needed?

Log into your CS50 IDE workspace and execute

[source,bash]
----
update50
----

within a terminal window to make sure your workspace is up-to-date. If you somehow closed your terminal window (and can't find it!), make sure that *Console* is checked under the *View* menu, then click the green, circled plus (+) in CS50 IDE's bottom half, then select *New Terminal*. If you need a hand, do just ask via the channels noted at the top of this specification.

Now execute

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/workspace/chapter2
----

to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

[source,bash]
----
~/workspace/chapter2 $
----

Make a new `caesar` directory inside of `chapter2`. You're now ready to go!

== Background

Supposedly, Caesar (yes, that Caesar) used to "encrypt" (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) confidential messages by shifting each letter therein by some number of places. For instance, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, ..., and, wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A.  And so, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar might write IFMMP. Upon receiving such messages from Caesar, recipients would have to "decrypt" them by shifting letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places.

The secrecy of this "cryptosystem" relied on only Caesar and the recipients knowing a secret, the number of places by which Caesar had shifted his letters (e.g., 1). Not particularly secure by modern standards, but, hey, if you're perhaps the first in the world to do it, pretty secure!

Unencrypted text is generally called _plaintext_. Encrypted text is generally called _ciphertext_. And the secret used is called a _key_.

.Encrypting HELLO with a key of 1 yields IFMMP.
|===
| *plaintext*    | H | E | L | L | O
| *+ key*        | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
| *= ciphertext* | I | F | M | M | P
|===

More generally, Caesar's algorithm (i.e., cipher) encrypts messages by "rotating" each letter by _k_ positions. More formally, if _p_ is some plaintext (i.e., an unencrypted message), _p~i~_ is the _i^th^_ character in _p_, and _k_ is a secret key (i.e., a non-negative integer), then each letter, _c~i~_, in the ciphertext, _c_, is computed as

[latexmath]
++++
c_i = (p_i + k) \bmod 26
++++

wherein latexmath:[\bmod 26] here means "remainder when dividing by 26." This formula perhaps makes the cipher seem more complicated than it is, but it's really just a concise way of expressing the algorithm precisely.

== Specification

Design and implement a program, `caesar`, that encrypts messages using Caesar's cipher.

* Implement your program in a file called `caesar.c` in a directory called `caesar`.
* Your program must accept a single command-line argument, a non-negative integer. Let's call it _k_ for the sake of discussion.
* If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should print an error message of your choice (with `printf`) and return from `main` a value of `1` (which tends to signify an error) immediately.
* You can assume that, if a user does provide a command-line argument, it will be a non-negative integer (e.g., `1`). No need to check that it's indeed numeric.
* Do not assume that _k_ will be less than or equal to 26. Your program should work for all non-negative integral values of _k_ less than 2^31^ - 26. In other words, you don't need to worry if your program eventually breaks if the user chooses a value for _k_ that's too big or almost too big to fit in an `int`. (Recall that an `int` can overflow.) But, even if _k_ is greater than 26, alphabetical characters in your program's input should remain alphabetical characters in your program's output. For instance, if _k_ is 27, `A` should not become `[` even though `[` is 27 positions away from `A` in ASCII, per http://www.asciichart.com/[asciichart.com]; `A` should become `B`, since `B` is 27 positions away from `A`, provided you wrap around from `Z` to `A`.
* Your program must output ``plaintext:`` (without a newline) and then prompt the user for a `string` of plaintext (using `get_string`).
* Your program must output ``ciphertext:`` (without a newline) followed by the plaintext's corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext "rotated" by _k_ positions; non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged.
* Your program must preserve case: capitalized letters, though rotated, must remain capitalized letters; lowercase letters, though rotated, must remain lowercase letters.
* After outputting ciphertext, you should print a newline. Your program should then exit by returning `0` from `main`.

== Hints

This program needs to accept a command-line argument, _k_, so you'll want to declare `main` with:

[source,c]
----
int main(int argc, string argv[])
----

Recall that `argv` is an "array" of ++string++s. You can think of an array as row of gym lockers, inside each of which is some value (and maybe some socks). In this case, inside each such locker is a `string`. To open (i.e., "index into") the first locker, you use syntax like `argv[0]`, since arrays are "zero-indexed." To open the next locker, you use syntax like `argv[1]`. And so on. Of course, if there are `n` lockers, you'd better stop opening lockers once you get to `argv[n - 1]`, since `argv[n]` doesn't exist!  (That or it belongs to someone else, in which case you still shouldn't open it.)

And so you can access _k_ with code like

[source,c]
----
string k = argv[1];
----

assuming it's actually there! Recall that `argc` is an `int` that equals the number of strings that are in `argv`, so you'd best check the value of `argc` before opening a locker that might not exist!  Ideally, `argc` will be `2`. Why? Well, recall that inside of `argv[0]`, by default, is a program's own name. So `argc` will always be at least `1`. But for this program you want the user to provide a command-line argument, `k`, in which case `argc` should be `2`. Of course, if the user provides more than one command-line argument at the prompt, `argc` could be greater than `2`, in which case, again, your program should print an error and return `1`.

Now, just because the user types an integer at the prompt, that doesn't mean their input will be automatically stored in an `int`. Au contraire, it will be stored as a `string` that just so happens to look like an `int`!  And so you'll need to convert that `string` to an actual `int`. As luck would have it, a function, https://reference.cs50.net/stdlib/atoi[`atoi`], exists for exactly that purposes. Here's how you might use it:

[source,c]
----
int k = atoi(argv[1]);
----

Notice, this time, we've declared `k` as an actual `int` so that you can actually do some arithmetic with it.

Because `atoi` is declared in `stdlib.h`, you'll want to `#include` that header file atop your own code. (Technically, your code will compile without it there, since we already `#include` it in `cs50.h`. But best not to trust another library to `#include` header files you know you need.)

Okay, so once you've got `k` stored as an `int`, you'll need to ask the user for some plaintext. Odds are CS50's own `get_string` can help you with that.

Once you have both `k` and some plaintext, `p`, it's time to encrypt the latter with the former. Recall that you can iterate over the characters in a `string`, printing each one at a time, with code like the below:

[source,c]
----
for (int i = 0, n = strlen(p); i < n; i++)
{
    printf("%c", p[i]);
}
----

In other words, just as `argv` is an array of ++string++s, so is a `string` an array of ++char++s. And so you can use square brackets to access individual characters in ++string++s just as you can individual ++string++s in `argv`. Neat, eh?  Of course, printing each of the characters in a string one at a time isn't exactly cryptography. Well, maybe technically if _k_ is 0. But the above should help you help Caesar implement his cipher!

Incidentally, you'll need to `#include` yet another header file in order to use https://reference.cs50.net/string/strlen[`strlen`].

Besides `atoi`, you might find some handy functions documented at https://reference.cs50.net/[reference.cs50.net] under *ctype.h* and *stdlib.h*. For instance, `isalpha` might prove helpful when iterating over plaintext's characters.

And, with regard to wrapping around from `Z` to `A` (or `z` to `a`), don't forget about `%`, C's modulo operator. You might also want to check out http://asciitable.com/, which reveals the ASCII codes for more than just alphabetical characters, just in case you find yourself printing some characters accidentally.
