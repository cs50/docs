== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope::
 To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?
Correctness::
 To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?
Design::
 To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?
Style::
 To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Getting Started

As always, we'll begin the setup process for this problem by logging into https://cs50.io[cs50.io] and executing:

[source,bash]
----
update50
----

From there, move into your `chapter6` directory. Then, download the distro for this assignment by executing:

[source,bash]
----
wget https://github.com/cs50/problems/archive/sentiments.zip
----

Then run the following commands to set up some names and permissions:

[source,bash,subs="macros"]
----
$ unzip sentiments.zip
$ rm sentiments.zip
$ mv problems-sentiments sentiments
$ cd sentiments
$ chmod a+x smile tweets
$ ls
analyzer.py     helpers.py          positive-words.txt  smile*     tweets*
application.py  negative-words.txt  requirements.txt    templates/
----

Back to the code in a bit!

== Background

"Sentiment analysis," otherwise known as "opinion mining," involves inference of sentiment (i.e., opinion) from text. For instance, movie reviews on https://www.rottentomatoes.com/[Rotten Tomatoes] are often positive or negative. So are product reviews on https://www.amazon.com/[Amazon]. Similarly do opinions underlie many tweets on https://twitter.com/[Twitter].

Some words tend to have positive connotations (e.g., "love"), while some words tend to have negative connotations (e.g., "hate"). And so, if someone were to tweet "I love you", you might infer positive sentiment. And if someone were to tweet "I hate you", you might infer negative sentiment. Of course, individual words alone aren't always reliable, as "I do not love you" probably isn't a positive sentiment, but let's not worry about those cases. Some words, meanwhile, have neither positive nor negative connotations (e.g., "the").

A few years back, Dr. Minqing Hu and Prof. Bing Liu of the University of Illinois at Chicago kindly put together https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#lexicon[lists] of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs50/problems/sentiments/positive-words.txt[2006 positive words] and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs50/problems/sentiments/negative-words.txt[4783 negative words]. We'll use those to classify tweets! But first a tour.

== Distribution

=== Understanding

==== `smile`

Open up `smile` in `sentiments/`. Suffice it to say that file's name doesn't end in `.py`, even though the file contains a program written in Python. But that's okay! Notice the "shebang" atop the file:

[source]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python3
----

That line tells a computer to interpret (i.e., run) the program using `python3` (aka `python` on CS50 IDE), an interpreter that understands Python 3.

Notice next that the program imports a class called `Analyzer` from a module called `analyzer` as well as a function called `colored` from a module called `termcolor`. The former you'll actually soon implement in a file called `analyzer.py`. (Recall that a class in Python is like a `struct` in C except that a class can also contain functions, otherwise known as "methods" when they're inside a class.) The latter colorizes output in terminal windows, as we'll soon see.

This program defines only one function, `main`, which gets called per the file's last line. Within `main`, we first make sure that `sys.argv` contains the expected number of command-line arguments. We then "instantiate" (i.e., allocate) an `Analyzer` object. We then pass to that object's `analyze` method the word that a user has provided in `sys.argv[1]`. As we'll soon see, that method will return a positive `int` if its input is positive, a negative `int` if its input is negative, and `0` if its input is neither positive nor negative. The program ultimately prints a colored smiley accordingly.

==== `analyzer.py`

Open up `anlyzer.py` in `sentiments/`. Not much going on in there (yet)! Notice, though, that it imports the http://www.nltk.org/[Natural Language Toolkit], among whose features is a http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html[tokenizer] that you can use to split a tweet (which is maximally a 140-character `str` object) into a `list` of words (i.e., shorter `str` objects).

In there is our definition of that `Analyzer` class, which has two methods: `++__init__++`, which is called whenever `Analyzer` is instantiated; and `analyze`, which can be called to analyze some `text`. That first method takes two arguments in addition to `self`: `positives`, whose value is the path to a text file containing positive words; and `negatives`, whose value is the path to a text file containing negative words. Meanwhile, `analyze` takes one argument in addition to `self`: a `str` to be analyzed for sentiment. Though that function is (temporarily) hardcoded to return `0` no matter what.

Recall that methods are automatically passed that first reference to `self` so that they have a way of referring to objects' "instance variables."

==== `positive-words.txt`, `negative-words.txt`

Open up `positive-words.txt` and `negative-words.txt` (without changing them). Notice that atop each file is a bunch of comments, each of which starts with a `;`. (Those are just text files, though, so the authors' choice of `;` is arbitrary.) The lists of positive and negative words, respectively, begin below those comments, after a blank line.

==== `tweets`

Open up `tweets`. Ah, another shebang. But nothing else besides a `TODO`! More on that soon.

==== `helpers.py`

Open up `helpers.py`. You should see two functions: `chart` and `get_user_timeline`. Given three values (`positive`, `negative`, and `neutral`, each an `int` or a `float`), `chart` generates HTML (as a `str`) for a pie chart depicting those values. Given a screen name, meanwhile, `get_user_timeline` returns a `list` of tweets (each as a `str`). That function uses https://twython.readthedocs.io/[Twython] (har har), a library for Python, to retrieve those tweets via https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api[Twitter's API] (application programming interface), a free service that can be queried programmatically for tweets. Notice how the function expects two "environment variables" to exist. Environment variables exist within your terminal window, key/value pairs that programs (like `tweets`) can access programmatically. We'll soon use two, `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET`, to store credentials for Twitter.

==== `application.py`

Open up `application.py`. In this file is a "controller" for a Flask-based web app with two endpoints: `/` and `/search`. The first displays the simplest of forms via which you can search for a user on Twitter by screen name. The second displays one of those pie charts categorizing that user's tweets. Notice, though, how 100% of those tweets are (temporarily) assumed to be neutral.

==== `templates/index.html`

Open up `templates/index.html`. In there is that simplest of forms. Notice how it figures out via `url_for`, a function that comes with Flask, to what URL the form should be submitted.

==== `templates/search.html`

Open up `templates/search.html`. Notice how this template renders a user's screen name as well as that pie chart.

==== `templates/layout.html`

Open up `templates/layout.html`. In here is a layout on which `index.html` and `search.html` depend. It leverages http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] to override browsers' default aesthetics.

==== `requirements.txt`

Open up `requirements.txt` (without changing it, though you can later if you'd like). This file specifies the libraries, one per line, on which all of this functionality depends.

== Getting Started

. In a terminal window execute
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/workspace/chapter6/sentiments/
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
----
+
to install these programs' dependencies.
. Sign up for Twitter at https://twitter.com/signup[twitter.com/signup] if you don't already have an account.
. Visit https://apps.twitter.com/[apps.twitter.com], logging in if prompted, and click **Create New App**.
+
--
* Any (available) *Name* suffices.
* Any (sufficiently long) *Description* suffices.
* For *Website*, input *++https://cs50.harvard.edu/++* (or any other URL).
* Leave *Callback URL* blank.
--
. Click *Create your Twitter application*. You should see "Your application has been created."
. Click *Keys and Access Tokens*.
. Click *modify app permissions*.
. Select *Read only*, then click *Update Settings*.
. Click *Keys and Access Tokens* again.
. Highlight and copy the value to the right of *Consumer Key (API Key)*.
. In a terminal window, execute
+
[source,bash]
----
export API_KEY=value
----
+
where `value` is that (pasted) value, without any space immediately before or after the `=`.
. Highlight and copy the value to the right of *Consumer Secret (API Secret)*.
. In a terminal window, execute
+
[source,bash]
----
export API_SECRET=value
----
+
where `value` is that (pasted) value, without any space immediately before or after the `=`.

If you close that terminal window and/or open another, you'll need to repeat those last five steps.

Next, try running

[source,bash]
----
./smile
----

to see how it works. Keep in mind that all words will be classified (for now!) as neutral because of that hardcoded `0` in `analyze.py`.

Next, try running

[source,bash]
----
flask run
----

and then select *CS50 IDE > Web Server* in CS50 IDE's top-left corner. Search for some user's screen name, and you should see a chart! Of course, it's all yellow for now because of that `100.0` in `application.py`. Quit Flask with control-c.

== Specification

=== `analyzer.py`

Complete the implementation of `analyzer.py` in such a way that

* `++__init__++` loads positive and negative words into memory in such a way that `analyze` can access them, and
* `analyze` analyzes the sentiment of `text`, returning a positive score if `text` is more positive than negative, a negative score if `text` is more negative than positive, and `0` otherwise, whereby that score is computed as follows:
+
--
* assign each word in `text` a value: `1` if the word is in `positives`, `-1` if the word is in `negatives`, and `0` otherwise
* consider the sum of those values to be the entire text's score
--

For instance, if `text` were "I love you" (and `Analyzer` were instantiated with default values for its named parameters), then its score would be 0 + 1 + 0 = 1, since

* "I" is in neither `positive-words.txt` nor `negative-words.txt`,
* "love" is in `positive-words.txt`, and
* "you" is in neither `positive-words.txt` nor `negative-words.txt`.

Suffice it to say, https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html[more sophisticated algorithms] exist, but we'll keep things simple!

=== `tweets`

Complete the implementation of `main` in `tweets` in such a way that program

* accepts one and only one command-line argument, the screen name for a user on Twitter,
* queries Twitter's API for a user's most recent 50 tweets,
* analyzes the sentiment of each of those tweets, and
* outputs each tweet's score and text, colored in green if positive, red if negative, and yellow otherwise.

=== `application.py`

Complete the implementation of `search` in `application.py` in such a way that the function

* queries Twitter's API for a user's most recent 100 tweets,
* classifies each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral,
* generates a chart that accurately depicts those sentiments as percentages.

If a user has tweeted fewer than 100 times, classify as many tweets as exist.

== Hints

=== `analyzer.py`

* Odds are you'll find http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#module-nltk.tokenize.casual[`nltk.tokenize.casual.TweetTokenizer`] of interest, which can be used to tokenize a tweet (i.e., split it up into a `list` of words) with code like:
+
[source,python]
----
tokenizer = nltk.tokenize.TweetTokenizer()
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(tweet)
----
+
For instance, if `tweet` is `I love you`, then `tokens` will be `["I", "love", "you"]`. The tokenizer treats some punctuation as separate tokens, so not to worry if it splits words like `a+` (which is in `positive-words.txt`) into two tokens.
* Be sure to ignore any comments or blank lines inside of `positives` and `negatives`.
* If you would like a variable to be accessible from both `++__init__++` and `analyze`, be sure to define it as an "instance variable" inside of `self`. For instance, if you were to define
+
[source,python]
----
self.n = 42
----
+
inside of `++__init__++`, then `self.n` would also be accessible inside of `analyze`.
* Odds are you'll find https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower[`str.lower`] of interest.
* Note that `get_user_timeline` returns `None` in cases of error, as might happen if a screen name doesn't exist or a screen name's tweets are private.
* And here's the https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity[time-complexity (aka "Big O" or "Big Oh") of various operations in current CPython], the implementation of Python we're using (which is an interpreter called `python`, or really `python3`, which itself is actually written in C).

=== `tweets`

* Look at `smile` for inspiration!
* Because `tweets` doesn't end in `.py`, CS50 IDE won't know it's Python code, so syntax highlighting won't be enabled by default. With the file open in a tab, change *Text* to *Python* in the tab's bottom-right corner to enable.

=== `application.py`

* Look (back) at `tweets` for inspiration!

== FAQs

=== Could not build url for endpoint '/'

If you find that when you try to search in your Flask app without typing anything into the text field, you get a `Could not build url for endpoint '/'.`, change the line in `application.py` that reads `redirect(url_for("/"))` to `return redirect(url_for("index"))`.

=== ImportError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'

If seeing this error, execute

[source,bash]
----
pip install --user sqlalchemy
----

to resolve!

=== twython.exceptions.TwythonAuthError: Twitter API returned a 401 (Unauthorized), An error occurred processing your request

If seeing this error, odds are you're trying to get tweets for a screen name that's protected (i.e., private)! Not to worry, though. You can assume we'll only test your code with screen names that aren't protected.

=== twython.exceptions.TwythonError: Twitter API returned a 404 (Not Found), Sorry, that page does not exist

If seeing this error, odds are you're trying to get tweets for a screen name that doesn't exist! Not to worry, though. You can assume we'll only test your code with screen names that exist.

=== TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

If seeing this error in a `for` loop, be sure you're indeed iterating over a `list` and not, e.g., `None`. In particular, be sure you're checking the return value of `get_user_timeline`, which, per its implementation, can return `None` in cases of error.
