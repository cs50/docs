== Free Candy

So, one of the best things about our office is the freefootnote:[We might have been the ones to hack the machine to be free.] candy machine.

Well, that and the stuffed cat poking his head out from the ceiling.

Anyhow, there's a whole lot of Skittles, Mike and Ike's, and M&M's in that machine. Want to guess how many Skittles? Glad you said yes! Your task in this problem is to implement, in a file called `skittles.c` inside of your `~/workspace/chapter1/skittles/` directory (remember how?), a program that first picks a (pseudorandom) number between 0 and 1023, inclusive, and then asks you (the human) to guess what it is.footnote:[To be clear, that range includes 1024 integers, from and including 0, to and including 1023.] The program should keep asking you to guess until you guess right, at which point it should thank you for playing.

Where to begin? Allow us to hand you some puzzle pieces.

To generate a random number, you can use a function called `rand`. Take a peek at its manual page, commonly called a `man` page, by checking it out on https://reference.cs50.net/stdlib.h/rand[Reference50].

Under *Synopsis*, we see that the function is apparently declared in `stdlib.h`. So you'll want to put

[source,c]
----
#include <stdlib.h>
----

atop `skittles.c` along with

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
----

as usual. The order of such includes tends not to matter, but alphabetical is probably good style.

Also notice that rand "returns a pseudorandom integer between zero and `RAND_MAX`." It turns out that `RAND_MAX` is a **constant** (a symbol that represents some value) that's defined in `stdlib.h`. Its value can vary by server, and so it's not hard-coded into the manual. Let's assume that `RAND_MAX` is greater than 1023. How, though, do we map a number that's between 0 and `RAND_MAX` to a number that's between 0 and 1023?

Turns out that C includes an operator--alongside the usual suspects of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division--called the *modulo* operator. Modulo (`%`) gives you the remainder after dividing its operands. But it can be useful for more than arithmetic remainders alone! Consider this line of code:

[source,c]
----
int skittles = rand() % 1024;
----

The effect of that line is to divide the *return value* of `rand` by 1024 and store the remainder in `skittles`. What might the remainder be, though, when dividing some integer by 1024? Well,
there might be no remainder, in which case the answer is 0. Or there might be a big remainder, in which case the answer is 1023. And, of course, a whole bunch of other remainders are possible in
between those bounds. Well there you have it, a way of generating a pseudorandom number between 0 and 1023, inclusive!

== That's So Pseudorandom!

There's a catch, though. It turns out that, by default, `rand` always returns the same number (odds are it's `1804289383`) the first time it's called in a program, in which case your program's always going to be filled with the same number of Skittles. Why is that? On the aforementioned Reference50 page, take a second to click that "More Comfy" radio button in the top-right corner of the page.

Whoa! That's a lot more detail. That's what the real `man` page looks like--a bit overwhelming. Still, some useful information seems to have been abstracted away in "Less Comfy" mode. In particular, there's a note under the Description that

[quote]
___________________
If no seed value is provided, the `rand()` function is automatically seeded with a value of 1.
___________________

A *seed* is simply a value that influences the sequence of values returned by a *pseudorandom number generator* (PRNG) like `rand`. To be clear, it's not the first number returned by a PRNG but, rather, an influence thereon.

This is why we say "pseudorandom" all the time instead of "random". Computers can't really generate numbers that are truly random: they have to start somewhere. How can you override this default seed of 1? Before you call `rand`, call `srand` with your choice of seed (e.g., 2):

[source,c]
----
srand(2);
----

Better yet, call `srand` with a seed that actually changes over time (literally), without your having to recompile your code each time you want it to change:

[source,c]
----
srand(time(NULL));
----

Never mind what `NULL` is for now, but know that `time(NULL)` returns the current time in seconds; that's not a bad seed. No need to store the return value of `time` in some variable first; we can pass it directly to `srand` between those parentheses. It's worth noting, though, that time is declared in `time.h`, so you'll need to include that header file too.

== Guesstimating

Alright, what other puzzle pieces do we need? Well, your program will need to tell the user what to do, for which `printf` should be helpful. And you'll want to allow the user an infinite number
of guesses, for which some looping construct is probably necessary. And you'll also want to get integers from the user, for which `get_int`, declared in `cs50.h`, is definitely handy.

Okay, where to begin? Allow us to suggest that you begin by filling `skittles.c` with this code:

[source,c]
----
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void)
{
    // seed PRNG
    srand(time(NULL));

    // pick pseudorandom number in [0, 1023]
    int skittles = rand() % 1024;

    // TODO
}
----

We'll leave the `TODO` to you! Remember, don't try to implement the whole program at once. Perhaps start by printing (with `printf`) the value of `skittles`, just to be sure that you didn't make any typos. Then save your code and proceed to compile it withfootnote:[If only it were that easy to make Skittles.]

[source,bash]
----
make skittles
----

To run your program (assuming it compiles with no errors), execute

[source,bash]
----
./skittles
----

to see how many Skittles there are. Wait one second and then run your program again: odds are the number of Skittles will differ. Then continue editing `skittles.c` and take another bite out of this problem. Perhaps next implement your program's instructions that explain to the user how to play this guessing game.

What should your program's output be, once fully implemented? We leave your program's personality entirely up to you, but below's one possible design. Assume that the underlined text is
what some user has typed.

[source,bash,subs=quotes]
----
~/workspace/chapter1/skittles/ $ [underline]#./skittles#
O hai! I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 1023. What is it?
[underline]#0#
Nope! There are way more Skittles than that. Guess again.
[underline]#1#
Nope! There are way more Skittles than that. Guess again.
[underline]#-1#
Nope! Don't be difficult. Guess again.
[underline]#1023#
Nope! There are fewer Skittles than that. Guess again.
[underline]#42#
That's right! Nom nom nom.
----

Your program should end once the user has guessed right. The above design happens to respond to the user's input in a few different ways, but we leave it to you to decide how much to vary your program's output.

Incidentally, know that you can generally force a program to quit prematurely by hitting ctrl-c. And you may be able to extrapolate from the phone book example: Finding a value between 0 and 1023 doesn't actually require that many guesses. Odds are you can test your program fairly efficiently. You can certainly use temporarily a modulus less than 1024 to save even more time; just be sure that your final version does pick a number in [0, 1023].

If you'd like to play with the our own implementation of `skittles` you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/chapter1/skittles

Unfortunately, testing this program falls to you, without the use of `check50`. Because your program should be generating pseudorandom numbers it is what computer scientists call **non-deterministic**, the behavior is not predictable from run-to-run. Be sure to play your game extensively to make sure all the corner cases are ironed out!

This was Skittles.
